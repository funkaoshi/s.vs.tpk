![The map I made before the campaign began][mine]

My Carcosa campaign has been running on and off for the last year and change. During that time the party has spent all of their time within the small region that surrounds the town of Invak, what amounts to their home base. [This the region of Carcosa I outlined (in brief) before the campaign began.][1] Enough has been going on in this region to keep them reasonably occupied.

Of course, the fact they haven't ventured further afield is probably due to me giving them few reasons to leave. (The one "quest" that would have pulled them away was to help a character my friend Gus really wasn't fond of anyway.) In the game world there is minimal trade or travel between towns, so it's unclear how rumours would spread to get the players to venture off into the wilderness.

One perk of playing with people who can draw is that they will sometimes draw things for you. Gus's map of the region is much nicer than my little hex map. He's also added details and embellishments that add some colour to what has been a pretty boring landscape.

![Gus's map of the region of Carcosa the game has taken place in][gus]

On the northern slopes of the mountains to the North are the yawning pits that lead down to the infamous and deadly *Putrescent Pits of the Amoeboid Gods*.

Directly South of the pits near one of the forks in the mountain river is the former citadel of the Orange Men cultists, now home to a small battalion of Bone Men from Invak.

Not pictured, though now known to the players, is the *the Slavers Citadel*, built into the side of a mountain. The gates to the slavers home is guarded day and night by men mounted on raptors. Slaves lay chained outside the citadel in an open air market. A pitched battle has begun between the Rainbow Connection and their allies and the Jale Slavers. 

*Decline* lays to the West. 60 Bone Men ruled by "the Ideal of Decline" once made their home in this ancient castle. It now sits empty, most of its former inhabitants believed to be mindless thralls wandering the wastes. Rumours suggest someone else has moved in.

From the Castle of Decline the tree sized mushrooms that make up *The Fungal Reach*. As one ventures up the river the mushrooms grow so tall and so close it makes travel difficult. There are a great variety of mushrooms within the "forest", each with their own interesting properties.
