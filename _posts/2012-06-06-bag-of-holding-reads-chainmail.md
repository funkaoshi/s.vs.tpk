Paul from [Bag of Holding][1] has been [reading through the rules for Chainmail][2]. One thing that stood out for him were the rules around Swiss and Landsknechte pikemen.

> At the Battle of Marignano, Swiss pikemen actually fought Landsknecht mercenaries. Because it was impossible for either side to lose, THE BATTLE IS STILL GOING ON.

It's interesting to look at the evolution of D&D from its war gaming roots. Each successive iteration of the game seems to lose a little bit more of the book keeping.
