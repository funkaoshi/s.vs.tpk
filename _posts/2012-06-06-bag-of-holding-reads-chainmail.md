Paul from [Bag of Holding][1] has been [reading through the rules for Chainmail][2]. One thing that stood out for him were the rules around Swiss and Landsknechte pikemen.

> At the Battle of Marignano, Swiss pikemen actually fought Landsknecht mercenaries. Because it was impossible for either side to lose, THE BATTLE IS STILL GOING ON.
