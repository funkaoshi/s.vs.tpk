Alas, poor Gretzyln, I hardly knew you.

At today's [D&D Encounters][1] session my poor cleric Gretzyln was vanquished by those most evil of elves, the [Drow][2]. He was supposed to be a hardboiled [deep gnome][3] ex-dungeoneer turned fanatical cleric of [Pelor][4], the sun god. I thought it was a cute idea: a guy who spends his whole life living underground leaves that life behind to worship the sun.

Gretzyln was not alone in his fate: it was a total party kill. I didn't think this blog would earn its name so quickly.

There were 5 people playing at session today: two wizards, an avenger, a vampire, and my cleric. It's probably not an ideal mix for a party, but that's always a possibility when you play in these sorts of pickup games. I didn't think it was particularly out of whack. We were facing off against some sort of Drow necromancer, her henchmen, and some skeletons she animated during the course of the fight.

I'm not completely sure what went wrong. The monsters were all higher up in the initiative order then us, so we did spend a lot of time reacting to them rather than getting out there and messing them up. I had to heal two of our party members (back from death's door) very early on in the encounter. The skeletons, though there were a lot of them, never really gave us any trouble. Our wizards were well suited to deal with them. We probably could have done a better job trying to avoid the Drow and all their ranged attacks, but I didn't feel like we were ceding that much of the fight to them. Then our DM started rolling like a man of fire, and our attempt to chase down the Drow and finish them off ended in ruin.

[Dungeon's Master has a more detailed write up of the week 3 encounter.][5] In the game he DM'd the party of 6 players defeated the Drow, but barely survived. That DM is a player in my game, and he mentions our defeat at the bottom of the post. He felt our lack of ranged attacks and a defender were the two biggest obstacles we failed to overcome.

Still, it was fun. And all is not lost. No doubt next week another of Pelor's followers will wind up chasing down some Drow to avenge their old friend and companion, that foolish cleric Gretzyln.
