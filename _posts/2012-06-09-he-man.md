_Carcosa_ is an absolutely stunning book. I think that needs to be said right off the bat, because it really is. It is probably one of the nicest books I own, period. Judging it purely on aesthetics--and really, isn't that what it's all about?--this book is amazing. So you should go out and buy it now. If that's not enough of an endorsement, I suppose you can read on.
