If you enjoyed the original [_Barrowmaze_][1] megadungeon, [you will probably want to head over to Indiegogo and support the creation of its sequel, _Barrowmaze II_][2].

> _Barrowmaze II_ is the second part of a two-part exploration-style megadungeon for Labyrinth Lord and other classic fantasy role-playing games. BMII is a continuation of the initial "dungeon sprawl" concept presented in _Barrowmaze I_ (BMI) and is intended for mid-and-high level characters.

I own the PDF of the original dungeon. It's a pretty creative take on megadungeons. Instead of having multiple levels, each more challenging then the previous one, Barrowmaze is basically a giant sprawling mess of rooms. The further you get from the entrances into the dungeon, the harder the encounters get. Barrowmaze is a crypt, and the room descriptions really play this side of its origin story up. For example, there are lots of sealed up tombs PCs can excavate in search of treasure at the risk of alert monsters to their presence.

Barrowmaze was created by fellow Canadian Greg Gillespie, who runs the blog [Discourse & Dragons][3].

Today is the last day of the _BarrowmazeI II_ funding campaign. It has already reached its funding goals, so its going to be available for purchase sometime in the future, even if you don't have the funs to support the project right now. There are some nice perks for backers of the project, so if _Barrowmaze II_ is something you think you'll buy in the future now is the time to act.
