I created Osrik, an (Essentials) dwarf paladin, to play at D&D Encounters this week after [the untimely death of my deep gnome cleric Gretzlyn][1]. I was thinking this Paladin would on the tail of his friend the cleric. I won't get a chance to flesh out his story, because I managed to kill this character as well. Two deaths in two weeks? For shame.

I'm enjoying D&D Encounters, but the last couple battles have been hard. I don't have any of the D&D Essentials books, so I also don't understand what's up with the Essentials versions of the characters I'm playing. The cleric couldn't turn undead, or do half the things I thought clerics were all about. The paladin couldn't heal. At all. What kind of paladin can't do a Lay on Hands?

All is not lost. I have a felling a Kobold Warlock is going to wander into this mess and start doing some avenging. And I know how to play a warlock. In theory, anyway.
