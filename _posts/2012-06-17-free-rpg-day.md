Saturday June 16th was [Free RPG Day][1]. If the name didn't give it away, the basic idea is that you show up at your local game store and you collect free RPG swag. [Goodman Games][2] was giving away [a DCC RPG module][3] that I was looking forward to grabbing. Different stores have different rules about how to distribute the items various publishers send them to give away. [Duelling Grounds][4], my local gaming store, was giving away stuff to anyone who participated in games that were being run that day.

Daniel, also known as [Raven Crowking][5] from the [DCC RPG message boards][6], had mentioned [he'd be running two sessions at Duelling Grounds][7]. There were two adventures in the Free RPG Day DCC RPG book, and he was planning on running each of them. I participated in the first adventure, _The Jeweler That Dealt in Stardust_.

There were two busy games of [Pathfinder][8] taking place when I arrived at the store, each with 6 players. DCC RPG doesn't quite have the same mindshare I suppose, so only I had arrived specifically to play in the DCC RPG game. Another fellow, Richard, who came to Duelling Grounds unaware it was Free RPG Day also joined us. We each played two characters: I grabbed a fighter and a halfling, while he took a thief and a wizard. _The Jeweler That Dealt in Stardust_ is a fun little adventure. It's a jewellery heist story with some demonic twists. How did we fare? Well if you've been reading this blog [you can probably guess][9]. To our credit, we had absconded with a ton of jewels and had defeated a demon, so we weren't slackers by any stretch. The adventure was a lot of fun.

We managed to get through it all in about 2-3 hours of play. I felt like we accomplished a lot in that time. DCC RPG plays quite fast. I was also impressed at how quick the game is to pick up. I had read through the rulebook, but never played the game. Richard had never even heard of the game before. We occasionally had to pause the game so Daniel could explain how the rules worked, but for the most part things work the way you expect them to. Though the game requires funky dice we made due with a 'normal' set of gaming dice and a D30.

Free RPG Day was a big success. I left Duelling Grounds with the DCC RPG module I was hoping for, a module for 4th Edition D&D from Wizards of the Coast, and a map of some fictional world called Harn. I finally got to play a game of DCC RPG, and meet a fellow DCC RPG fan. It was a good day.
