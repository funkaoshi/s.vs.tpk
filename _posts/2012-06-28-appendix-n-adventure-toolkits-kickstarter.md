If you're looking for the next Kickstarter project you should be supporting, look no further than Brave Halfling Publishing's [Appendix N Adventure Toolkits (DCC RPG Modules)][kickstarter]. For $20 you can get a copy of 5 modules and a slew of other bonus material. From the Kickstarter:

> Each Appendix N Adventure provides Game Masters with a challenging adventure that can easily be dropped into an existing campaign, as well as an inspirational module map and a set of illustrated player handouts. Each also contains new monsters, unique enemies, creative traps and bizarre settings to challenge players, and inspirational ideas for expanding the campaign and launch points into further adventures for the Game Master.

The project is already funded. You have nothing to lose. If the project hits $15,000 than they plan to also release a new campaign setting.

> Five years ago, I spent many months working on a unique campaign setting ("The Old Isle") to help try and spark renewed interest in Gary Gygaxâ€™s rpg, "Lejendary Adventures." With Gary and Gail's blessing, I consulted with Gary frequently about the design of the setting, npc races, magic item creation, divine beings, etc. I bounced ideas off of him and he provided suggestions and critiques. It was a very special time in my hobby gaming that I still treasure. However, while Gary played a supportive but indirect role in my creation of the Old Isle Campaign Setting, he did not create or write one word of the setting - The Old Isle is 100% my creation. Maps were created and art was commissioned. With Gary's passing and the end of his Lejendary Adventures game, I decided to not release this material. However, from the first time I read some of the early DCC RPG play-test material, I knew this campaign setting had found a new home!

If you haven't used Kickstarter before, this is a great first project to support. Brave Halfling Publishing has been around for a long time, and has a great reputation. They already have 6 modules ready to go, so you're really only paying to help them bootstrap their printing costs. This seems like a pretty low risk venture. By the sounds of things, you should expect modules in the mail by July or August. That's pretty fast turnaround for Kickstarter.
