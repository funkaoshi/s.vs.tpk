[James Raggi][1] of [Lamentations of the Flame Princess][2] is running this crazy crowd funding project during the month of July. He has set up [19 different IndieGoGo campaigns][3], each requiring $6000 in funds. The ultimate goal would be to raise $114,000. That's some aggressive crowd funding.

The last campaign he ran raised $16,240 to fund [a hardcover book edition of the LotFP rules][4]. Prior to that he raised $6,241 to fund [two adventure modules][5]. Clearly there are people out there interested in LotFP. My fear is that there are not enough people to fund such a large body of work in a single month. That would be a real shame, because the more I learn about the people involved in the campaign the more disappointed I'll be if some of these adventures don't get funded.

I love [the Dungeon Alphabet][6]. I'm also a fan of [Michael Curtis's blog][7]. So, without much thinking whatsoever I supported [his adventure][8].

Today I was listening to an episode of [the Jennisodes][9], a podcast about role-playing games, which featured [Kevin Crawford][10], another participant in this campaign. I had never heard of him before, but after listening to him wax-poetic about sandbox gaming for a half hour I now want to fund [his campaign][11] as well. It sounds like it will be amazing. (Oh, and the host of the Jennisodes is [also hoping to write an adventure for LotFP][12].)

I read [Jeff's Gameblog][13], by Jeff Rients, another participant in this campaign. I assume [his campaign][14] will do well as he seems to have a bit of a following in the OSR community. His writing on D&D is all quite fantastic. He posted [a video][15] today] about what he wants to do in his adventure. Guess what? It sounds pretty fantastic too.

I assume if I learn anything about most of these writers I'm going to want their adventure. As far as I can tell there are no B-team participants. Everyone seems to bring something interesting to the table. [Monte Cook][15] is writing an adventure! One of the [dudes from mother-fucking members of GWAR][16] is writing an adventure! It's ridiculous.

I don't have $114,000 to spend on adventures. Most people probably don't. I suppose the hope then is that in aggregate fans of LotFP and of these individual writers can get a few things funded. This is certainly feels like the golden age of crowd funding--every other post on this blog seems to be about a kickstarter project--but this project might be a bit too ambitious. Still, I wish Raggi the best of luck. He has $20 of my dollars--so far.
