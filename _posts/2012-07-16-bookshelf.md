I've added a new page to this site, [listing the D&D books I currently own][bookshelf].[^1] I like seeing what books (and PDFs) other people own, as it's a good source for finding new books that might be worth reading. That page will also be a good place to link back to reviews i've written about the books I've bought. For someone who doesn't actually **play** that much D&D, I own a lot of books on the subject. I suppose this page also exists to shame myself into not buying more D&D books.

[^1]:  I shamelessly stole this idea from [Untimately][], which [I recently mentioned on this blog][untimately-post].
