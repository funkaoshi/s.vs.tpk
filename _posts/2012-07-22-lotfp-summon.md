Over the last few days i've been working on [a little web application][summon] to help [Lamentations of the Flame Princess][lotfp] players go through the motions of casting the Magic-User's Summon spell. The spell lets players summon a demon to aid them--hopefully. The LotFP rules outline what sort of demon will show up and whether or not it will listen to the players. It's a crazy spell. There are lots of tables and dice rolling. It's a complicated enough procedure that it produced [a thread on the LotFP forum][lotfp-forum] to discuss how exactly the spell works. From the discussion there I figured turning the spell into a little web-application would be a small fun project.

For those interested, the site was created using the Python (mini) web framework, [Flask][], and is hosted on [Dreamhost][].
