I have mixed feelings about the [Dragonfoot][] forums. They are a pretty great resource for all things old-school D&D. On the other hand they are also filled with all the horribleness one finds in a forum of reasonable size. Still, I don't think there is a better source for stuff like this: the ["B1 - In Search of Unknown" index][dragonfoot-b1] thread is full resources and reviews of the D&D module [_In Search of the Unknown_][b1]. It's probably got a link to anything of interest about that module.
