I recently discovered that there is a small convention that takes place in Toronto focused on old-school table-top gaming. [OSRCon][] takes place this weekend. It sounds like it will be fairly small as conventions go, and the focus seems to be about running and playing games. If you are in or around Toronto it seems worth checking out. How easy is it to bump into people who are into old-school D&D? (That's a rhetorical question.)
