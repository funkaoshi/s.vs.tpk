I wasn't completely sure what my schedule this past weekend would be like: I knew I was quite busy. When I discovered [OSRCon][] was a thing happening in Toronto I bought tickets anyway. Even if I couldn't go it felt like a worthwhile event to support. I was hoping I'd be able to participate a little bit, at the very least. As it turns out I managed to do much more than I thought I would over the two days the event ran.

I arrived a bit late on the first day hoping to watch [Ken St. Andre][ken] running a game of [Tunnels and Trolls][t&t]. I wasn't signed up for any games, and I knew Ken's game was full, so I didn't feel like waking up early on my day off. I arrived a half hour after his game was set to start, but managed to avoid missing any of the action. As I settled into a chair away from the gaming table I realized Ken was still discussing the finer points of Tunnels and Trolls. He spoke at length about his game. He's clearly very passionate about T&T, and happy to proselytize about it when given the chance. Brendan from [Untimately][] had a similar idea as myself, showing up shortly after me planning to watch the game. Ken saw both of us just sitting there and offered to let us join in. Brendan took him up on his offer and picked a troll to play. When he had to duck out for lunch--which was more or less when the game got going--I took over the character. The adventure was interesting, even though we didn't get too far into the ["Dungeon of the Bear"][dungeon]. Our party had a series of misadventures trying to venture down into the dungeon itself. Failing is often as much fun as succeeding with role playing games. Ken is definitely an old-school DM, out to kill his players. (Or as he put it, out to create situations where the players kill themselves.) He is a certainly character, and I'm glad I got to meet him. It was an experience.[^1]

In the afternoon I played a game of Labyrinth Lord run by a Carter Soles of [The Lands of Ara][ara], who had made the trip to Toronto from Rochester. I had to duck out early (the reason I hadn't signed up for anything in the afternoon), but I did get to do a fair amount of adventuring before my departure. Our party was off to investigate a presumably haunted keep, and investigate we did. The thief I rolled up had 2 hit points, so he was a little bit of a coward. Sometimes 3d6 in order works in your favour and sometimes it doesn't. This character was all kinds of meek. You have to love basic D&D characters: they are the true everyman. I suppose that is part of the charm of playing basic D&D. Our first encounter was against some undead rats. When rats are a scary threat you know you're playing old-school D&D.

My second day at OSRCon began with the only game I had actually signed up to play. James Maliszewski of [Grognardia][] fame was running an Original D&D game, taking players through his megadungeon [Dwimmermount][]. We actually managed to get through a fair amount of dungeon in a small amount of time. There was a lot of exploring and the occasional fight. I plan on doing a play report shortly. Suffice it to say I had a lot of fun.[^2]

There was a panel discussion in the afternoon, featuring [Ed Greenwood][greenwood] of [Forgotten Realms][forgotten] fame, Ken St-Andre, Lawrence Whitaker from [Runequest][], and James from Grognardia. It was interesting hearing how these guys all ended up where they are today and their thoughts on writing and gaming. Ed Greenwood is particularly engaging. He explained that his professional writing career began by writing letters to Penthouse for $25 a pop. Apparently Dragon magazine paid $20 a pop for monsters and was more prompt in paying him. The rest is history. The talk probably would have worked better with a moderator leading the discussion and keeping people on point. The talk went a half hour or so longer than it was supposed to, and it felt like no one really knew when it was supposed to stop. Ed Greenwood and Ken St-Andre sitting next to each other discussing the game was definitely quite the scene, so I suppose we shouldn't complain too much.

The day concluded with another round of games. Like the day before I had to leave early, so I elected to watch Ed Greenwood run a Forgotten Realms game. That guy is amazing. He puts the **role** in role-playing. I don't think I've seen a DM quite so animated. He would literally act out the part of every NPC the players encountered--even the monsters that can't actually talk. It was great to watch. I'm not sure how well i'd handle having to actually play in a game like that. He clearly approaches the game as shared story telling. Often I find I just want to kick in doors and kill goblins.

These last two days were the first time I had played basic D&D in a very long time, at least 15 odd years. I was surprised at just how much of the rules I had forgotten. Say what you will about 3rd and 4th edition, but they did a great job at rationalizing the game system. One success of those games is that you can more or less guess the mechanic needed to resolve any action. With basic D&D some situations call for a d6 roll, others 2d6, others a d20; sometimes you need to roll high, other times low. The game is simpler, but at the same time maybe not as simple as it could be. Of course, old-school D&D is simple in ways that that 3rd and 4th Edition don't come close to competing in. I rolled up characters a few minutes before both the games I played in. If my characters died and I had to start again, I feel like I could have rolled up a character in a few minutes tops. These early games feel light and easy to get in to. 4th Edition feels needlessly complex with all its classes and options.

OSRCon was a lot of fun. I got to meet a bunch of fellow table top gaming enthusiasts and play a bunch of games. I don't get to play that much D&D, so it was a nice change of pace.

[^2]: I had backed the project to get them printed on Kickstarter. I don't know if I'd ever want to run Dwimmermount myself, but I supported the project anyway as a thank you for writing such a great blog. I actually have copies of the levels of the dungeon we traveled through. I had avoided reading any of this material in the hope I would get a chance to actually go through the dungeon as a player.
