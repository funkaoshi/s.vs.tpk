As I mentioned in [my previous post on OSRCon][osrcon], I got to wander through the dark halls of [Dwimmermount][] on Saturday morning in a game run by [James  Maliszewski][grognardia]. What follows may ruin the surprise of some of the rooms in the dungeon: you have been warned.

We began with 5 players. We rolled up characters using the original D&D rules, and for a change my rolls weren't half bad. Strength was my highest score so I decided to play a fighter. We used [Brendan's random equipment lists][equipment] to pick items, so this whole process was very quick. Buying items is probably the slowest part of the character creation process in D&D. I think we all had characters ready to go in about 10 minutes. The bulk of that time was probably spent trying to find the saving throws tables in the old D&D books.[^1] When all was said and done we had three fighters, a magic user and a cleric ready to go. We also brought two hirelings with us: Mary the Torchbearer, known for her ability to carry a torch, and a porter of no real repute.

Like all good one-shots ours began at the foot of a dungeon. Our group had marched into Dwimmermount in search of gold, presumably. The stairs into Dwimmermount entered into a room with 5 statues. Thankfully they weren't booby trapped. Neither was the room. When playing the previous day in Ken St. Andre's Tunnels and Trolls game, our group spent a **very** long time trying to get into the dungeon. It's possible that in James' actual Dwimmermount game this room is full of machine guns, but if you only have a few hours to play it probably doesn't serve you well to kill all your players a few minutes into your game.  We had 4 doors to choose from, one for each direction, and we chose to go East.

I was ready to just walk into the next room, but [Brenden][], a more patient and prudent player, thought we had a better chance with this dungeon crawl if we proceeded a bit more cautiously. From this point on every door we opened (that had a circular pull) was opened by looping rope through the pull and tugging the door open. Before we ventured into any room we'd listen for noise first. In this fashion we ventured East till we came across a circular room with a set of masks hanging on the wall. One mask was missing, and in front of where it should have been there was a long dead man, now just a pile of bones. I know what you're thinking: it's a trap! And you'd be right. Examining the skeleton revealed the missing mask. There wasn't any indication on his body that he'd been hit by some sort of projectile. Looking at the wall we could see a small hole where the mask would have sat, so we guessed there was some sort of poison gas trap protecting the masks. Now I was ready to just move on, happy I'd avoided the booby trap. Smarter and/or greedier heads prevailed. We decided to carefully loop our rope through the eyes and mouths of the masks and then tug them all off the wall from a safe distance. Sure enough we could hear the room filling up with gas as the masks hit the floor. Our first "loot": who wouldn't want creepy death masks from a dungeon?

From here we ventured South. We ended up on the Eastern edge up of a long corridor. There were plenty of doors to open. We ignored the double doors to the East: never trust double doors. The first set of doors to the South eventually led us to the stairs down to the next level. We weren't quite ready to head down yet.

We walked back to the long corridor and checked out the next room to the South. We found a library with some books and maps that looked like they might be of value. More loot!

Further South was another door behind which we could hear the muffled voices of something, we couldn't be sure what. One of the other fighters and myself got in place, and we busted that door open. We encountered a bunch of monsters, who looked monstrous and maybe vaguely dwarven. They were small, anyway. We shouted, "surrender!" but they weren't having any of that. Myself and the other fighter made short work of the first wave that approached us. The rest started to flee. The magic-user in the group thought we just weren't speaking the right language. He shouted "surrender and join us", but this time in dwarven. That didn't go over too well. The ones that were fleeing ran back, angrier than they already were. Lucky for us we were wearing plate mail.[^2]

At this point we could have continued South. We had heard some noises coming from that direction. Maybe we would have encountered more of these crazy definitely-not-dwarves. We decided the best course of action was to start making our way down as deep as we could into Dwimmermount. We were being a bit too cautious for a convention game. I mean, I hadn't even named my Fighter.

And this play report is already longer than I thought it would be, so you'll have to wait for [the excitement of level 2!][level-2]


[^1]: James has a very slick hardback version of the little brown books that he built using his copies of the old Wizards of the Coasts PDFs and Lulu. I was surprised and how good the hardbacks Lulu produces are. It made me want to print up some PDFs.
[^2]: It costs next to nothing in OD&D. I think by the time you get to 2nd Edition it's thousands of GP.
