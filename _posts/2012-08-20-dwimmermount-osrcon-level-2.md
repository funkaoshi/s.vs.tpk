After a short break we [continued][level-1] our delve of [Dwimmermount][]. We were joined by two more players: another magic-user, and the dumbest fighter ever--the poor guy had a Wisdom score of 3--who was played to perfection by [Steve Conner][steve-conner]. It turns out those two characters were with us all along, of course.

At the foot of the steps down to level two were a set of lifeless bones wearing armour with weapons at their side. That's certainly unusual. Our cleric tried to turn them to no effect. You can't turn a bunch of bones, after all. We walked further down the steps and then they sprung to life. (Maybe you saw that coming.) So began an exploration of the second level of Dwimmermount.

We headed South, finding a room with 6 pillars. Each pillar was made out of a unique material, and each had a character inscribed upon it. In a normal game we would have spent much longer puzzling out what this room was about. As we were playing for a fixed amount of time we quickly moved on. This came up often when exploring the second floor. Because this was a convention game we didn't dedicate as much time as probably would have in a normal game trying to understand what the rooms we encountered were about. There were lots of strange and interesting rooms on this floor we quickly glossed over. Our focus was more survival and gold.

From here we went East, eventually stumbling upons the ruins of a library. Some careful searching revealed a secret room filled with a cache of books we assumed were of some value. The dilemma: there were hundreds of pounds of these books. We each grabbed one, and decided to move on. We would come back for them at some later date. (Well, in our imaginations, I suppose.)

We moved North from here, passing a room with shattered statues and a stone gargoyle we proceeded to shatter ourselves. We were waiting for it to spring to life. Nope. James informed us that room was now completely full of broken statues. Destroying things was a recurring theme with our party.

Further on we found a room with writing on its walls we couldn't read. The funny thing about this situation was that we had previously had a conversation about _Read Magic / Language_ being a useless spell because no one ever wastes a spell slot on it. Both our magic-users had charm and sleep. We couldn't figure out what to do about the writing so we decided to make a sketch and back track.

Heading North once more, we came across another set of pillars. There were four of them, each made of glass, and they ran floor to ceiling seemingly beyond this level in both directions. Each contained one of the four elements. We were going to move on, but someone had a pretty great idea: the air pillar was empty, so why not smash it open and jump down to a lower level of the dungeon. (OK: maybe "great" is the wrong adjective to use with respect to the idea.) We got to smashing and eventually broke enough of the pillar we could send a man through. The problem: we had assumed we had found an empty pillar; in fact air was zipping through the pillar very quickly. We spent a fair amount of time throwing things down the hole to see how fast they sped away, and if we could hear them landing somewhere safely. After some scientific research we decided jumping down was probably not a good idea. Steve's fighter needed to be talked off the ledge, so to speak.

The very next room we encountered contained several large glass tubes, with doors. Guarding the giant empty tubes were hobgoblins. Our magic-user didn't feel like another fight so he shouted, "sleep!" and that was that. We decided we would carry one hobgoblin with us to interrogate later. The rest? Well we fed them to the dungeon disposal system we had just found in the previous room. They zipped away to places unknown.

We explored a little bit more, and would have continued to explore indefinitely had [Brendan][] not asked, "can we grab all of those books we found in the secret room, head back to town, try and level up, and then come back to the dungeon 'two weeks later'"

And so it came to pass we found ourselves levelling up characters in the middle of a one-shot. James didn't bother rolling for random encounters, something i'm guessing he would do if this was a normal game. As such our exit was without incident. My character actually didn't earn enough gold to get to the next level, but other players fared better. (We each were grabbing odds and ends as we made our way through Dwimmermount, hence the disparity.) The hobgoblin we were lugging around was now a charmed hireling known as long hair, because we had fed him a potion of hair growth while he was unconscious. (We learned it was a potion of hair growth when his hair started growing.) With that we headed back into the dungeon, right back to where we left off. Once again, I suspect James skipped a few steps to speed things along.

The very first room we encountered when back in the dungeon was once again full of hobgoblins, but also a metric ton of treasure. God damn it! If we had explored one more room before heading back to town we all would have definitely gained a level.

From here we once again encountered a series of strange rooms we didn't have time or energy to investigate fully: a triangle painted on the ground, probably magical; a room full of statues of gods with their heads replaced, and finally a locked door. We could hear what were probably horrible monsters behind it, so it was probably for the best the doors were locked.

We were running short on time. We back tracked to the start of the level and made our way East. We replaced one charmed hobgoblin hireling with another, after the first was killed in battle with the second. We pressed on, but ultimately our search for a way to the third level wouldn't be fruitful. No one can say we didn't try.

The game was a lot of fun. James wasn't to fussy about a lot of the more tedious rules one would probably pay more attention to in a typical dungeon crawl. We weren't really tracking time, how long torches last, etc. I think these things can be an important part of the game, but if you are only playing for 3-4 hours, there are much better things to focus on. James also drew the map of Dwimmermount as we explored. (I made my own copy, as I knew I'd want to write about this game later.) This all helped the game run quickly and smoothly. I felt like we accomplished so much in such a short period of time.

This game was probably the highlight of my time at OSRCon. I felt like we had a good group, and that we all had a good time. If you have a chance to play in a game with James I recommend you take it.
