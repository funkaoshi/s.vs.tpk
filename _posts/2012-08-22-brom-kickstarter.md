![The art of Brom][brom-art]

[Gerald Brom's][1] art work shaped the way the Dark Sun game setting evolved. He would paint scenes that the game designers would then use as inspiration when building the world and the game mechanics that went with it. He has a very distinctive and I would say classic fantasy style. His work reminds me a little bit of the work of [Frank Frazetta][2]. Heâ€™s probably the greatest fantasy artist alive today--yeah I said it. [He also has a Kickstarter project on right now to fund a retrospective book of his work.][3] I'm losing my shit over here.
