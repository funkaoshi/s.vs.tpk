There were lots of other bloggers besides myself in attendance at [OSRCon][]. As one might imagine many of them wrote about their time at the convention. [Grognardia][] has a post about OSRCon along with another post about [running Dwimmermount][dwimmermount-1] with Ken St. Andre as a player and one [about the game I participated in][dwimmermount-2].  [Discourse and Dragons][greg] covers the convention as well, and in particular about playing in this infamous game of D&D with Ken. Speaking of [Ken][], he has a post with lots  of photographs about his time in Toronto. Two Americans I met at the convention, [Carter][] and [Brendan][], both wrote about their time in Toronto and their feelings around the convention. Carter ran the Labyrinth Lord game I played in on Friday afternoon. Steve, who ran the Boot Hill games, discusses the convention and the OSR from a non-D&D point of view in two posts: [Reflections Part I][steve-i] and [Reflections Part II][steve-ii]. Last, but not least, we have [Untimately][] and [Akratic Wizardry][akratic]'s comments on the convention.
