![Combat by Henry Justice Ford][hjf-img]

Since starting this blog the amount of D&D I've been playing has increased greatly. I continue to participate in the Encounters games held at [Dueling Grounds][deuling-grounds]. In addition to those games I've been playing a fair amount of old-school D&D: a weekly game run by Brendan of [Untimately][] and occasional games run by James M of [Grognardia][] and Reynaldo of [Baroviania][] fame. After playing so much D&D recently I find the differences between the modern incarnation of D&D and its older editions are quite stark.

[D&D Encounters][encounters] is very much the pathological case of a 4th Edition game. Each session is distilled down to the core of 4th Edition: mostly combat with a tiny bit of role playing. For many people D&D Encounters is their first introduction to D&D. After playing in these games for several months now my feeling is that they teach bad gaming habits. Killing things is more or less the only option open to players to resolve conflicts. You might be able to avoid a fight, but there is a disincentive to do so because then you would probably end up with a very short game. Because each Encounters session needs to transition into the next there is also no room for exploration or change. You can't take a session in a wild new direction.  This isn't true of 4th Edition, obviously, but is of D&D Encounters. I think a good DM can do a lot to keep the game interesting, but the structure of the adventures hinders a lot of creativity. 

The [Dwimmermount][] sessions I've participated in are actually similar in scope to the Encounters sessions. Dwimmermount offers a good alternative to running a pick up game. Each session is more or less a self contained unit of adventure: you begin on some level of the dungeon and end things back outside. There isn't some overarching story that ties the Dwimmermount games together. The story is the exploration of the dungeon; the story is what you and the other players choose to make it. Each session can end in all sorts of strange ways because there is no need to lead into the next chapter of a particular adventure. 

I'd love to see a D&D Encounters game that was just a dungeon crawl, but i'm not sure that will ever happen. The current structure lets people discuss the game they played in like they might a TV show. Everyone doing their own thing doesn't facilitate that sort of conversation. 

Combat is fast in the older editions of D&D. This is because it's very abstract. My old-school D&D sessions often feel like they are full of accomplishment. In a few hours you can do a lot: lots of exploring, lots of fighting, lots of puzzles. 4th Edition is much more tactical and meticulous in its presentation of combat. An Encounters session is usually an hour and a half, give or take, and the bulk of that time is spent on a single fight.

I think most people would agree that faster combat is better, but the way 4th Edition handles combat is not without its merit. Because 4th Edition combat is far less abstract you can talk about that fight in a level of detail you don't often get with older editions of D&D. [Dungeon's Master's recaps of his Encounter's sessions][recap] are usually quite long, despite the fact they are primarily a description of a fight, because the pieces that make up combat are quite expressive. You really feel the ups and downs of a fight in 4th Edition. In the last game I played we had a round where almost everyone was down, we were on the verge of a total party kill, only to manage a big come back big the next round. It was amazing.

I'm curious to see if the structure of the public play events Wizards of the Coast runs will change with the release of [D&D Next][next]. Combat in D&D next is much faster so adventures wouldn't need to be modeled as a series of fights. They would presumably still be quite linear, but I suspect you could accomplish more per session than you do in the current Encounters program. There are rumours that the next Encounters game will be more varied in what happens week to week. We will have to wait and see.
