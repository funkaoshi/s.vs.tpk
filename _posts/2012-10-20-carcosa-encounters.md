In [_How Brightly Coloured Should Carcosa Be?_][carcosa-article] [Richard Guy][richard-guy] discusses the relationship between [_He-Man and the Masters of the Universe_][he-man] and [_Carcosa_][Carcosa]. It's probably one of the most enjoyable things i've read since getting back into gaming.

With that in mind, here are 16 new hex descriptions for your Carcosa game. 

<table class="random-table">
<tr><th>1D16</th><th>Hex Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>An Orange Man (AC 14, MV 160', HD 4, Chaotic) dressed in furs hunts a band of mutant men. He is armed with a whip and accompanied by 2-12 giant beasts and dinosaurs; these creatures are under his complete control.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 18, MV 120, HD 3, Chaotic): a blue arachnoid with two red eyes and a toothed mouth. It currently entangled in a grappling hook and 100' of rope. An orange laser pistol can be found in its belly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1 Deep One.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Village of 278 Yellow Men ruled by “the Evil Queen,” a Chaotic 9-th Level Sorcerer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>A humanoid robot (AC 16, MV 90', HD 4, Chaotic) guards the remains of a crashed alien spaceship. He is armed with a sword and a laser pistol. His 3 large eyes rotate about his head. He can not be surprised and will react with hostility to all who approach.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A Blue Man Cyborg with a metal jaw and a robotic hook arm (AC 18, MV 90', HD 4, Chaotic) commands a group of 6-36 Blue Men bandits armed with bone weapons. The bandits demand the players hand over any metal items in their possession, which their leader will proceed to eat. The Cyborg earns +1 to hit for each piece of metal he consumes; this effect lasts one day. (When encountered he has a 0-3 bonus to hit.) His hunger for metal can not be satiated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>A hulking Blue Man (AC 15, MV 120', HD 6, Chaotic) with unusual red hair wields a cursed two handed sword. (This character wields the sword one handed, carrying a shield in the other.) Any character possessing the sword is compelled to eradicate all white men from the world; with each white man they kill their hair turns a darker shade of red. The sword is -1 to hit, but +3 to hit vs. White Men.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Monastery of 56 Brown Men ruled by “the Golden Hand,” a Chaotic 5-th Level Fighter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Village of 156 Green Men ruled by "the Dragon," a 4th-level Sorcerer. The Sorcerer's research has left him disfigured: he has the scales and tail of a lizard, and is cold blooded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 18, MV 90' / 120' [swimming], HD 3, Neutral [intelligent]): an orange anthropoid with scaly skin, two yellow eyes, and a toothed mouth. One of its arms is an oversized claw. In its other hand it carries a green mace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>A large bird of prey stalks the players. After 1-3 hours it will turn and fly off into the distance. The bird does not attempt to hide its presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>A disfigured two-headed mutant man lays face down in the ground. His body is half purple &amp; half blue. Characters who investigate the body must make a Save vs. Death Ray each turn or suffer a random mutation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>A Purple Man hangs limp from a tree. He is pierced head to toe by spikes. Two tridents lay near his lifeless body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>12 Black Men led by putrid smelling Sorcerer (AC 18, MV 120', HD 3, Chaotic) are in the middle of casting <em>Manifestation of the Putrescent Stench</em>. The Sorcerer is armed with a laser pistol and wears a bright orange alien space suit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>4 Snake Men attempt to repair a time machine. The Snake Men and their collection of high-tech gadgetry are incomprehensible to characters with an intelligence score less than 18.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>A massive snake shaped citadel coils around the peaks of a craggy mountain. Within 22 Bone Man are led by a Chaotic 16th-level Sorcerer. He is planning the total conquest of Carcosa.</td></tr>
