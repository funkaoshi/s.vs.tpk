[Delving Deeper][1] was released as [a set of PDFs yesterday][2]. It's a retroclone of the [Original D&D][3] rules. The only other edition i'm aware of that is similar in scope is the [Sword and Wizardry White Box][4]. Unlike the White Box, Delving Deeper stays much closer to Original D&D in its rules. I also think it's a much better laid out and organized product. The White Box PDF feels more verbose than it need be. That said, some of the additional exposition is good for getting a better understanding of Original D&D. The White Box also feels like a neglected product, with Sword and Wizardry seemingly more interested in their other products.

Original D&D is an incredibly simple game. Delving Deeper would be a great edition to use to teach someone how to play D&D. [There are only a few mechanics for resolving problems][5], there are only a handful of character classes, and all the rules and spells fit in a 34 page booklet. People complain Original D&D is a bit ambiguous at times, and it certainly can be, though I think that's part of its charm. If you have one player who knows how to play D&D I think the ambiguity won't be a problem.

[Delving Deeper is available for free][6] so you should certainly check it out. The PDFs by Simon J. Bull are really well done. I heartily recommend it. If I ever run a game I think I'll use this ruleset.
