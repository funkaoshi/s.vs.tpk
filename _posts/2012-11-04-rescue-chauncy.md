On Friday I played a D&D one-shot to rescue a character from [Wampus County][1] trapped in [Carcosa][2]. It was a lot of fun. What follows is a Carcosa-esque play report. Gustie, from [Dungeon of Signs][3], [has a more traditional and detailed play-report up on his blog as well.][4] The session was run by Brendan, from [Untimately][5], who has [a write up of the wilderness we were exploring][6]. I forgot about the dead T-Rex in my write up below.

For full on Carcosa glory, [you can view this encounter on my Random Carcosa website.][7]

Encounters in **Hex 1807**:

<table class="random-table">
    <tr><th>Hex Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>A Bone Man (AC 3, MV 60', HD 1+1, Lawful) and a Jale Women (AC 9, MV 120', HD 1+1, Neutral) explore the badlands in search of alien technology for their war tribe.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A party of 2-8 inter-dimensional travelers search for their lost companion. They are armed with turn of the century firearms: pistols &amp; shotguns. They are cautious around and distrustful of any natives of Carcosa they encounter. They will however aid anyone who agrees to help them find their friend.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3-18 red orbs can be seen floating in the distance.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2 Unquiet Worms make their home in the shade of a disabled alien tank. Within the tank, two dead aliens lay mummified in their spacesuits. Sufficiently intelligent creatures can restore the tank to working order after 2-6 turns of experimentation.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Trails of small insects converge on the rocky husk of a massive dead insect. Within an inter-dimensional traveler to Carcosa lays shackled to the ground. Insects crawl in and out of his body. A sorcerer and his minions are in the middle of casting the ritual <em>Canticle of the Crawling God</em>. They will summon the Crawling God in 1-3 hours.</td></tr>
</table>

You may use the following table to restock the hex:

<table class="random-table">
    <tr><th>1D4</th><th>Hex Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>3-18 red orbs lay inert on the ground throughout the badlands. If investigated characters must make a Save vs. Poison or develop a random mutation.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>The Crawling God crosses the badlands trailed by a sea of insects.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>2 Unquiet Worms feast on the remains of a small party of adventurers. On the bodies can be found: pistols, shotguns and worthless foreign currency.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>A Bone Man rides through the badlands on an alien tank. He is accompanied by an inter-dimensional traveller to Carcosa. Within the tank is a small cache of books describing sorcerous rituals and the dead body of a Jale Woman.</td></tr>
