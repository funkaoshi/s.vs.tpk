The first module for Geoffrey McKinney's new imprint [Psychedelic Fantasies][1] is [_Beneath the Ruins_][2] by [Alex Fotinakes][3]. The module describes the first level of the vast ruins of Kihago. One might describe the dungeon as "gonzo": there are laser pistols and weird science, mutant men, and yeast monsters.

The dungeon is divided into three main zones. Two of the zones are controlled by warring factions: the Luminites, who worship ancient alien technology and believe nothing exists outside of the dungeon, and the Tribe of Yrtuk, mutant men who have lived in Kihago for centuries. The third zone of the dungeon is a no man's land, both tribes considering it too dangerous to explore. There are two optional sub-levels that can be used if you want to run the module as a self-contained unit. The author also recommends using the dungeons as the first level of a large complex. The booklet concludes with a handful of new monsters and stats for lasers guns.

The module is 16 pages long, printed as a long skinny booklet. This is a really great format for an adventure. (Though, I think it would have worked well as a two-column digest sized booklet as well.) The cover contains the map and is detachable. Each page holds a fair amount of information. Room descriptions are short enough I could imagine running the adventure with almost no prep. The type is a bit small, but I don't think its hard to read. Some thought has clearly gone into the layout of the booklet. Room descriptions rarely cross pages--I found one exception, and here the break is clear as it happens mid-sentence. When a monster appears in a room its stat blocks is separated from the room description making it easy to pick out which rooms have monsters. All in all its clear this module is meant for your gaming table.

Beneath the Ruins is probably one of the better modules I've purchased recently. It's also **incredibly** cheap. You should check it out.
