Continuing [my series of great D&D blogs][1], may I sugest the consistently good [Dungeon of Signs][2] by Gustie[^1]. It's hard to pick any one thing to highlight, so I'll point out the most [recent post][3] about his demon infested ocean liner megadungeon the [HMS APOLLYON][4]. The post is a good mix of great writing, art, and creativity that is more or less the staple of each and every post on his site. Why are you still reading this? Go!

[^1]: I now play D&D with him weekly, so this review isn't completely unbiased: though I thought the blog was pretty great before we had ever met.
