Last June I emailed my cousin, asking him if he could draw me a banner for this website. He can draw, and I can't. And so I patiently waited. The old banner for this site was an image by [Earl Norem][1]. I love He-Man more than most anything, but it was very much a place holder for an image I new was on the way. Yesterday night I got an email saying he had finished drawing my banner. Now it's time to write some blog posts.

Good bye He-Man, you will be missed.
