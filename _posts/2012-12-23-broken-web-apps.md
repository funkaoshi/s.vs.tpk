**Update 2012-12-26**: And we're back: our long national nightmare is over.

Just a heads up to my readers, and random Internet people, that my three D&D web apps: Random Carcosa, The LotFP Summon Spell, and my Random Character builder are all offline at the moment. My host seems to have broken them when moving my account to a new server. It's Christmas so I don't expect my host to get back to me with what's up too quick, and i'm not sure I'll have time to dig into this for the new few days.
