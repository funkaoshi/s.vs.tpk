Over the holidays I picked up the last of the recent batch of DCC RPG modules, DCC RPG 74: Blades Against Death. I continue to buy the modules despite not having any real plans to run any DCC RPG games in the near future. (Or any games, for that matter.) The art work continues to the be the main draw.
