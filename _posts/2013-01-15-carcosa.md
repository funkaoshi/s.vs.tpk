I quite liked [_Carcosa_ by Geoffrey McKinney][carcosa]. I enjoyed it so much I wrote a very long review of the book split over several blog posts. To make sharing the review with other people easier I've collected links to each blog post below:

 * [The Mysterious _Carcosa_][1]
 * [_Carcosa's_ vile black magic][2]
 * [The Monsters of _Carcosa_][3]
 * [A Tour of _Carcosa_][4]

If you aren't interested in reading all of that noise just go buy the book already. There isn't anything else quite like it.
