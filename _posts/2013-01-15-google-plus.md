I am moving all the discussion on this site over to [Google+][1]. As it stands most of the discussion that takes place about my posts happens there anyway, and it's also where I go to read about and discuss D&D. If you aren't on Google+ you might be surprised to learn it has a very active RPG community. I had thought Google+ to be a ghost town in the world of social media until stumbling upon all these people who use it to [run games online][2] and discuss table-top gaming. If you are on Google+ please add me and i'll include you in my RPG circle.
