The Will is the latent Psionic power many Athanians possess. The Way is the study of Psionics in the pursuit of harnessing that latent power. Those in possession of the Will and the Way are known as Mindbenders.

Mindbenders are a powerful force on Athas.

### Wild Talents

Any Dark Sun character that doesn't play a Mindbender should roll under their Wisdom score to determine if their character has a wild psionic talent. If you fail the roll your character has no wild talent; if you succeed, the amount you succeed by determines your wild talent as follows: 

 R | Power
---|--------
 0 | Pick one power from entries 1—8 in this table.
 1 | **Far Hearing** - For one turn, the character hears all sounds within 50’ as if they were being whispered directly into their ear. The character may choose what sounds to focus on.
 2 | **Far Seeing** - For one turn, the character may view a scene up to 50' away as if they were right there.
 3 | **Thought Projection** - The character may communicate a brief message mentally with a creature up to 50' away. The target understands the character, even if they share no common language. 
 4 | **Object Projection** - The character may teleport a small object in their possession up to 50' away.
 5 | **Telekinetic Grasp** - For one turn, the character may manipulate small objects from up to 50' away.
 6 | **Spark** - The character may ignite any flammable object within 50' of them. (The “heat” this power generates is no greater than a candle.)
 7 | **Know Direction** - The character knows which way is North.
 8 | **Cell Adjustment** - The character regains up to 1d3 lost hit points. (This increases to 1d6 at level 3, 1d8 at level 6, 1d10 at level 9 and 1d12 at level 12.) The character may make a Save vs. Poison to cure themselves of any non-magical disease.
 9 | **Mental Blast** - This psychic attack deals 1d6 damage to any *sentient* creature within 100’ targeted by the character. (This increases to 2d6 at level 5, and 3d6 at level 10.)
10 | **Force Blast** - This telekinetic attack deals 1d6 damage to any creature within 100’ targeted by the character. (This increases to 2d6 at level 5, and 3d6 at level 10.)
11 | Roll twice on this table, using a d10.
12 | **Psychic Distress**: All sentient characters, friend or foe, within 25’ of the character are immobilized for 1 turn.
13 | **Minor ESP**: The character may communicate with another creature for 3 turns. (The characters understand one another even if they share no common language.)
14 | **Minor Mind Control**: The character may manipulate the target into doing whatever the character wants, for 1 turn. The target will have no memory of any events that transpire while under this mind control.
15 | **Minor Precognition**: The character may re-roll any saving throw, with a +4 bonus.
16 | **Psionic Immunity**: The character can not be the target of any psionic power.
17 | **The Haitian**: no character within 10' of the character, friend or foe, may use their psionic powers. The character also gains **Psionic Immunity**.

A character may use their psionic power once per day. (**Psionic Immunity** and **The Haitian** are exceptions here: they are always active.)
