I've updated my [Random Character Generator][1] to spit out a table of characters in one go: [Random NPCs][2]. My assumption is that a list of random NPCs with stats and basic descriptions could come in handy. If anything, you can use it to quickly generate a bar fight.

A quick tip: you can add a number to the end of the `npcs` URL to generate that many NPCs. (It currently caps out at 1000.)
