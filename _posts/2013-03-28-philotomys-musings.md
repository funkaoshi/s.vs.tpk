I've put [Philotomy's Musings][1] by Jason Cone back online. You can head over to the grab bag section of my site to read them. It joins [the He-Man show bible][2], so it is in good company.

When I got back into old school D&D one of the first websites of note I came across were Philotomy's Musings by Jason Cone. The writing there was my first experience with Original D&D as a scholarly pursuit. The 1974 D&D rules are so minimalist they beg to be interpreted. His writing was one such interpretation, one that gained much well deserved popularity.

I am using the [NYTâ€™s Emphasis library][3] to let readers link to individual paragraphs and sentences on that page. I will probably start using it through out the site, it's quite cool. If you do any long form writing its worth checking out.

I'd love to host the original D&D rules online in a similar fashion, but I'm guessing Wizards of the Coast wouldn't be cool with that.
