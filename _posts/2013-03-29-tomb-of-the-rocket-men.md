My friend Gus from [Dungeon of Signs][1] is running [a contest][2]. He wants you to draw him a map for the following locale, which he plans to key and run in his gonzo science-fantasy D&D game.

> Screened by thicket, swamp and forest, a necropolis of the ancients sinks slowly into the earth.  Its existence rumored by foresters and vaguely referenced in some of the Temple of Science's oldest logs, the tombs and monuments have remained slumbering and undisturbed for ages. Ancient construction materials provide protection against the elements, but in the glorious times when man traveled beyond the sky tombs were not considered sport for plunder and the treasures of the ancient sky-farers should be unguarded, untrapped and ready for any hand that has the audacity to reach for them!  Hack through the brigand haunted forest and seize the wealth of the very stars, amongst the TOMBS OF THE ROCKET MEN!

I'm not 100% sure why he's bothering with this contest, because if you look at his dungeon maps they are all amazing. Still, I would be remiss if I didn't enter. I ended up drawing something that looks like an office building or an old high school. That is to say it is kind of boring. [This means **you** have all the more chance to win!][2]
