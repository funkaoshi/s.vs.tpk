I printed out and bound the [Vancian Magic supplement from Gorgonsmilk][1]. I find all the folding and sewing relaxing. The book seems like it is actually a little bit too big to work as a saddle-stitched booklet. Maybe i'm just not good at making them. At 90-odd pages its a pretty meaty supplement. The book collects 2 stories by Jack Vance, 4 articles about magic in D&D by Gary Gygax, and a re-imagined Vancian spell list for D&D.

I had never read anything by Jack Vance before. I found the two short stories presented here really quite good. Vance produces a very evocative world in just a few pages. Both stories contain plenty of examples of the bizarre version of magic one finds in D&D: wizards can memorize a handful of spells, which they can cast just once before they are forgotten until they are memorized again. The stories definitely increased my appreciation of the magic system used in D&D.[^1] Previously it felt both arbitrary and not particularly fantastical.

The articles by Gygax are all great picks. Gygax explains why he went with Jack Vance as his source for magic in D&D. Briefly, Vancian Magic lends itself well to balanced and fun game play. One of the articles is from 1980 and discusses magic in AD&D. It's full on Gygax raging against people doing it wrong DMG style and its fantastic.

Finally we get to the re-imagined D&D spell lists by Shadrac MQ. The spells have great names and really imaginative effects.

This supplement is free, features art from Moebius, and collects some great writing: why haven't you grabbed it already?

[^1]: The stories both contain footnotes with commentary about how the fiction relates back to D&D: a good idea poorly executed. Most of the footnotes offer up obvious insight or simply repeat what you just read. Anyway, it's a small gripe: the footnotes are small.
