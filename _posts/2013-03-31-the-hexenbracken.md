Zak Smith (from [D&D with Pornstars][1]) took a [hex map by Brendan from Untimately][2] and asked people on G+ to fill it up with descriptions. Over the course of a few days he filled in the entire map with little descriptions.

[Random Wizard][3] took all the descriptions and put them [up on Google Docs][4]. I saved the Google Docs file as a CSV and wrote [a Python script to spit out everything in a slightly nicer format][5]. You can view the resulting web page over here: [The Hexenbracken][6].

If you are a little bit tech savvy, you can edit the Google Doc as outlined in Zak's post, and use the python script I wrote to create your own version of the site. You can also work with the CSV file in the repo directly.

In a follow up post about this project, [Zak discusses how to run a 'hexcrawl'][7].

This is some serious ass communal game development at its finest.
