[Zak Smith][1] was so happy with how his [previous crowd sourced hex crawl][2] went he decided to run another. This time I actually participated, offering up a few hex descriptions of my own. All told we had 66 people writing for the project. All the more interesting, this was all [organized and run on Google+][3], the ghost-town social network.

This project seems perfectly suited for a crowd sourced effort. The little descriptions are quite varied and creative, and producing all of them happened quite quickly. I suspect if you asked a single person to write up 400 odd hex descriptions they'd fall into a certain amount of sameness pretty quickly. This is a common complain with [Carcosa][4], for example. Taking a bunch of junk like this and cleaning up can also be a chore, but a few people offered to help and that made the process go much quicker and probably better than it would have had one person done the editing alone.

People also did a good job expanding on each others descriptions, making the area described feel alive. I mentioned early on that in [Hex 0116][5] a group of spies were making their way to a city just North of that Hex. I mentioned they were from a far off city in a Hex that had yet to be described. Well before we got to point that city was fleshed out other people had written about the city.

[The Kraal][6] sounds like an interesting place to run an adventure. You should check it out.
