Continuing with the theme of my last random encounters for _Carcosa_, here are an additional set of weird encounters for your PCs to stumble upon.

d16 | Encounter
----|-----------
 1  | A Green Man cyborg (AC 18, MV 60', HD 6, Lawful) leads a battalion of 3-12 soldiers. They are armed with an assortment of Alien weaponry. The cyborg will repair any Alien technology Lawful PCs may possess. He is searching for his daughter.
 2  | Citadel of 98 Red Men led by "The Ram", a Lawful 4th-level Fighter. "The Ram" is a hulking beast of a man, never seen without his indestructible helmet.
 3  | A Brown Man (AC 14, MV 120' / 160' \[Flying\], HD 6, Lawful) has replaced his both his arms with giant wings. Horrible scars mar his body. There is a 2 in 6 chance that when encountered the man will be in flight.
 4  | A White Man (AC 16, MV 120', HD 2, Neutral) wearing an Orange breast plate sits on a giant Cthulhu shaped throne, alone at the lowest levels of the Cavern of the Time Lords. He may share his knowledge of Carcosa with those who seek him out.
 5  | Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 14, MV 120, HD 6): An Orange humanoid with a smooth hide, and 3 heads. One head is humanoid (and Lawful), one head is robotic (and Neutral) and the last head is bestial (and Chaotic).
 6  | A squat Purple Man Sorcerer (AC 12, MV 90' / 120' \[Flying\], HD 2, Lawful) in flowing robes and an over sized hat is in the process of botching the ritual _Susurration of the Purple Cavern_.
 7  | 3-18 Giant Hornets. One of the beasts is twice as large as the rest and intelligent.
 8  | A Brown Man (AC 16, MV 120', HD 2, Lawful) with a cybernetic augmentation that allows him to extend his head several meters above his body is surveying the wilderness. He can not be surprised.
 9  | A damaged Alien vehicle, with 4 tank treads instead of wheels. Characters with an intelligence of 16 or more may attempt to repair the machine, with a cumulative chance of 10% per week of succeeding. (i.e after ten weeks the tank will be repaired.) It is large enough to comfortably transport 12 men. 
 10 | Village of 366 Yellow Men ruled by "the Silver Fist," a Lawful 6th-level Fighter. The Silver Fist rides into battle on cybernetic horses and wields a mysterious purple sword.
 11 | A Green Men (AC 12, MV 120', HD 1, Lawful), his skin sprouting moss, is on the run from his tribe. The smell of the man's moss skin has an effect on people similar to that of a sleep spell.
 12 | A White Woman (AC 14, MV 120', HD 4, Lawful) is locked in battle with a Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 14, MV 120, HD 2, Chaotic): a White anthropoid with a smooth hide, 5 eyes, and a toothed mouth. She fights with a large wooden staff and looks to have the edge on the beast.
 13 | 1 Orange Mastodon. The beast may shoot acid from its trunk 3 times a day.
 14 | A giant grey castle sits empty save for its custodian, an Orange Woman 18th-level Sorcerer. The castle is circumscribed by a bottomless chasm. A single bridge leads to its imposing doors shaped in the visage of a skull. The sorcerer will not leave the castle, and is immortal and invulnerable while within its walls. She will aid all those who actively seek to defend Carcosa from the forces of Chaos.
 15 | A beautiful young woman, an astronaut from Earth, lays wounded in a recently crashed spacecraft. The ship is damaged beyond repair. 
 16 | Village of 704 Dolm Men ruled by "The Master of the Universe," a 1st Level Fighter. He wields a magic sword in battle: on command the sword grants +20 HD, and the saving throws of a 20th level Fighter. If its owner is killed the sword returns to its home within the Grey Castle, mentioned previously. Only those chosen by the powers of the Grey Castle may hold aloft the sword.
