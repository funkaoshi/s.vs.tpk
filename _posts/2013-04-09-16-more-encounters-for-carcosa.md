Continuing with the theme of [my last random encounters for _Carcosa_][1], here are an additional set of weird encounters for your PCs to stumble upon.

d16 | Encounter
----|-----------
 1  | A Green Man cyborg (AC 18, MV 60', HD 6, Lawful) leads a battalion of 3-12 soldiers armed with an assortment of Alien weaponry. The cyborg will repair Alien technology Lawful PCs may possess, and will attack any PCs who make their allegiance to the forces of Chaos known. He is searching for his daughter.
 2  | Citadel of 98 Red Men led by "The Ram", a Lawful 4th-level Fighter. "The Ram" is a behemoth of a man, never seen without his indestructible helmet.
 3  | Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 14, MV 120, HD 6, Multiple Alignments \[intelligent\]): An Orange humanoid with a smooth hide and 3 heads. One head is humanoid (and Lawful), one head is robotic (and Neutral) and the last head is bestial (and Chaotic). When first encountered, or whenever the creature is under stress, roll a d6 to see which head is currently in control of the beast: 1-2 - the humanoid; 3-4 - the robot; 5-6 the monster.
 4  | A Jale Man Sorcerer (AC 16, MV 120', HD 8, Neutral) wearing a Red breast plate sits on a giant Cthulhu shaped throne, alone at the lowest levels of the Cavern of the Time Lords. He may share his knowledge of Carcosa with those who seek him out.
 5  | Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 14, MV 120' / 160' \[Flying\], HD 6, Neutral \[intelligent\]): A Brown avioid with a feathered hide and a toothed mouth. There is a 4 in 6 chance that when encountered the beast will be in flight. Man-made googles shield its eyes.
 6  | A squat Purple Man Sorcerer (AC 12, MV 90' / 120' \[Flying\], HD 2, Lawful) in flowing robes and an over sized hat is in the process of botching the ritual _The Glyphs of the Ebon Lake_.
 7  | 1 intelligent Sabertooth Tiger.
 8  | A Blue Man (AC 16, MV 120', HD 2, Lawful) with a cybernetic augmentation that allows him to extend his head several meters above his body is surveying the wilderness. He is armed with a bright yellow mace and can not be surprised.
 9  | A damaged Alien vehicle, with 4 tank treads instead of wheels. Characters with an intelligence of 16 or more may attempt to repair the machine, with a cumulative chance of 10% per week of succeeding. (i.e after ten weeks the tank will be repaired.) It is large enough to comfortably transport 12 men. 
 10 | Village of 366 Brown Men ruled by "the Silver Fist," a Lawful 6th-level Fighter. The Silver Fist rides into battle on cybernetic horses and wields a mysterious purple sword.
 11 | A foreboding grey castle sits empty save for its custodian, an Orange Woman 18th-level Sorcerer. The castle is circumscribed by a bottomless chasm. A single bridge leads to its imposing doors shaped in the visage of a skull. The sorcerer will not leave the castle, and is immortal and invulnerable while within its walls. She will aid all those who actively seek to defend Carcosa from the forces of Chaos.

 13 | A White Woman (AC 14, MV 120', HD 4, Lawful) is locked in battle with a Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 14, MV 120, HD 2, Chaotic): a White anthropoid with a smooth hide, 5 eyes, and a toothed mouth. She fights with a large wooden staff and looks to have the edge on the beast.
 14 | 1 Orange Mastodon. The beast may shoot acid from its trunk 3 times a day.
 15 | A beautiful young woman, an astronaut from Earth, lays wounded in a recently crashed spacecraft. The ship is damaged beyond repair. 
 16 | Village of 704 Dolm Men ruled by "The Master of the Universe," a 1st Level Fighter. He wields a magic sword in battle: on command the sword grants +20 HD, and the saving throws of a 20th level Fighter. Only those chosen by the powers of the Grey Castle may hold aloft the sword.
