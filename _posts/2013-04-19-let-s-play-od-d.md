[Talysman of The Nine and Thirty Kingdoms offers up the reasons he enjoys playing OD&D.][1] He touches on a lot of the reasons I quite like the system as well. After playing 4th Edition for a few years, playing OD&D is quite refreshing. If you have a few tables printed out there is almost nothing that will slow down a game. A lot of what is spelled out concretely in later editions of the game is left up to the players and DM to resolve, which ideally leads to less looking up rules and arguing about whether you have cover or combat advantage or this or that. The game relies on you using your judgement and common sense to adjudicate situations the rules don't flesh out. It feels like there are *just* enough rules to play the game, and no more.
