[Tickets for OSRCon are on sale starting today.][1] The event takes place here in Toronto in August, on the weekend of the 3rd and 4th. [I had a great time last year.][7] Besides getting to play a bunch of retro D&D, something I hadn't done in a long time, I got to meet [James M from Grognardia][2], [Brendan from Necropaxis][3], and a host of other people. [Ed Greenwood][4] signed my [Ruins of Undermountain][5] box set and I got to see him run a game which was pretty zany. This year [OSRCon][6] is taking place in a smaller venue, so the number of attendees is capped at 50 odd people. If you're interested in attending you should grab a ticket early. It's well worth checking out.
