Here's a nice update to my post on [Dungeons of Dread][1]. Wizards of the Coast's has published [the illustrations booklets for each of the adventures][2]. This makes the hardbacks so much more useful as a gaming resource. ([I had asked Mike Mearls about this on Google+][3], and he had mentioned it was probably something they would do.)

Wizard's also got [Jason Thompson's][5] to make walkthrough maps of the 4 modules, and they are amazing: [Tomb of Horros][5], [White Plume Mountain][6], [Expidition to the Barrier Peak][7], [Lost Caverns][8].
