I was off in England when this blog had its one year anniversary. The [first post][1] on this site was May 29th of last year.  My original goal was to have a space I could talk about D&D that wouldn't bore the people who read my other website, [A Funkaoshi Production][1]. I have tried to avoid forcing myself to write on a regular schedule. D&D has become a much bigger hobby in my life recently, so it's still often been the case I have something nerdy to discuss over here.

A lot of the more interesting things on this site weren't actually produced by me, really. The biggest hits to this site are now people looking for [the Hexenbracken][7], [the Kraal][8] and the [Colossal Wastes of Zhaar][9]. Those community hex crawl projects were a lot of fun to work on.

I suppose my bigger contribution to the online gaming community is actually my [random character generator][4]. It's probably one of the most used side projects I've worked on. I'm hoping to do more interesting things with it this year. The other two tools I wrote this year, [Random Carcosa][5] and [The LotFP Summon Spell][6], are probably much more niche, though I am quite happy with both.

This last year actually went quite fast. I've got to play much more D&D than I thought I would. Hopefully that keeps up this year.
