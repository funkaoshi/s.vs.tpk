It's been a few months since [I last wrote about Kickstarter][ks]: I thought I should check back in. A few projects I backed have indeed shipped since that mostly gloomy report. I got my [Weird West Miniatures][11] a month or two after posting my original article. The [Crawler Companion][5] was released. I am hoping to pick up a copy of the [LotFP 2013 Free RPG Day Adventure][1] this weekend, and I've already received two modules as PDFs as part of that project.

I'm still waiting for quite a few projects. The two other [LotFP][] projects I backed are still outstanding. It sounds like the [Rules and Magic][10] book is on the cusp of being shipped. Updates aren't as frequent as I like, but it sounds like there is good progress being made on most of the projects. Some of the [modules I backed][7] sound like they are shaping up to be quite great. [The Seclusium of Orphone][baker] went from being a 32 page booklet to a 160 page hard cover book! [Dwimmermount][13] looks like it might actually be finished before the year is out. The goal is to get the version I backed out by [Gencon][8]. The recent updates on the project sound both interesting and promising.

I have so much stuff outstanding from [Brave Halfling Publishing][bhp] in addition to the [Appendix N Adventure Toolkits][6]. The man behind the project has had a very hard year, so I find it hard to get worked up about, but i'm not sure I'd have backed this project or bought anything in hindsight. [Champions of Zed][9] continues to be the most lacking of all the projects I've backed, though [Machinations of the Space Princess][4] has also had some pretty lackluster communication about what's been going on. (**Update 2013-06-19** A few days after posting this I got a PDF in the mail for Machinations of the Space Princess, so that's that.)

I have backed one new project since my last post, [Domains at War][0], which are rules for running a war game. Learning from their past mistakes with Kickstarter projects, it looks like [Autarch][] went into this Kickstarter with the manuscript for their book almost complete and play tested. They are estimating the book will ship in October, and I almost believe them.
