[Kim Mohan was interviewed on the D&D podcast.][1] He was a figure involved in Dungeons and Dragons I had never heard of, but there is apparently no one out there who has worked on Dungeons and Dragons longer than the man. He was a managing editor at TSR and then Wizards of the Coast. There are lots of great quotes. On [Ed Greenwood][2]: "For every word that he gives you, you feel like heâ€™s holding fifty in reserve. And for every ten that he gives you he probably could have kept three or four."
