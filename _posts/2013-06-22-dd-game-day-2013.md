![The Map of the Vault of the Dracolich](/assets/img/2013-game-day.jpg)

I had another successful Free RPG Day this past Saturday. In addition to getting some free RPG books, I got to play a some D&D Next, the new fangled version of D&D coming out in 2014. Derek from [Dungeon's Master][1] was the Toronto organizer for a public play event from Wizards of the Coast, an adventure entitled [_Vault of the Dracolich_.][2]

The set up is straight forward enough: a Wizard needs a group of adventurers to find a magical staff he had been unable to retrieve when he was a young adventurer. He gives the party a rough map of the caverns the artifact is located within and warns the party they won't be able to retrieve the staff without first disabling four wards that protect it. To do so they'll also need to find four idols hidden in the caverns. With that brief intro we were teleported off to the caverns in search of adventure. Our motley crew numbered forty odd people. What!?

There were five tables participating in the adventure. It was designed to be tackled by multiple groups at the same time. Each table was teleported to a different starting location. We each had a team leader whose character had a magic item that would let them talk to the leaders from the other tables. In this way we could communicate things we had found or encountered while traveling through the dungeon. Occasionally the groups would bump into each other while adventuring. This happened at my table while we were fighting a giant Hydra. Our DMs coordinated things like how many hit points the monster had left, and ended up having half the Hydra's heads attack one party, the other half attacking the other. We would also come across places other parties had passed through. My group had to fight this giant Treant because a previous party had apparently harassed the monster: our attempts to reason with it were for naught. The session ended with a giant fight: we split into groups of four, each group had a different objective. My table had to fight this Dracolich simulacrum, whose ass we kicked.

This was my second time playing D&D Next. I hadn't played a game [since the very first play test rulebooks were released][3]. The game has evolved a fair bit since then, and is a bit more complicated. That said, on the whole it is **much** more straightforward than 4th Edition, and plays **much** faster. Our 3-4 hour D&D Next session would have probably taken four times as long using 4th Editions rules. Not using minis for most of the combat sped things up considerably. The lack of long lists of powers and complicated combat mechanics helped as well. I felt like we got a lot accomplished during our session. Even though no one at our table had played Next before things went fairly quickly.

I am curious to see if Wizards of the Coast can maintain the appeal of the game to people who enjoy 4th Edition. One of the ladies I played with has only ever played 4th Edition, and she found the combat in D&D Next a bit boring. I think a lot of people enjoy the extremely detailed and tactical combat of 4th Edition. If your only experience with D&D is 4th Edition, I can see how the simpler combat mechanics of all the other editions might seem like a step backwards.

I'll be playing [D&D Encounters][4] this season using the D&D Next rules. It seems like a great step forward. It's probably one of the easiest versions of the game to teach, especially if you don't play with any of the feats.  Thus far I have to say i'm a pretty big fan.

The game day was a lot of fun. Although i'm quite happy playing D&D online nowadays, there is something to be said for actually playing in person.

[^1]: More on this soon. I read it over the last couple days and it really is a fantastic adventure. My biggest complaint is that it needs an executive summary and the cover is kind of cheesy.
