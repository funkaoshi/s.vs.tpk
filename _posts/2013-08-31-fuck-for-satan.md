The latest limited edition module from [James Raggi][1] is [_Fuck For Satan_][2]. You can pick up a hand numbered copy from his online store. I got the 35th copy, apparently. There are 666 in total, of course. The cover art is awesome. This adventure features missing children, a haunted hill, a cult, aliens, and some fucking. This thing has it all. If only it was good. **This review is full of spoilers.**

In _Fuck For Satan_ the players are tasked with finding some missing children. This will lead them through a small, but tough, dungeon, one that will be a real slog to get through. There is a warning telling the players as much before they even go in, but who is going to heed that warning? There are no wandering monsters, so players will have all the time in the world to screw themselves. And they probably will.

The dungeon is quite linear. There are basically three spokes to explore. I can appreciate the reason for this: the dungeon is a big red-herring, the children aren't there. If this dungeon was obnoxious to map and navigate players might spend far too long trying to look for that one spot they haven't checked out yet. They might never clue in to the fact the children aren't here.

A couple traps in this adventure trigger when the characters see them. As I mentioned in my review of the [_Monolith Beyond Space and Time_][3], that's kind of a boring way to trigger a trap. If you want something to happen all the time you should just say "this thing happens all the time no matter what the players do," because most players aren't walking through dungeons blind folded, led by charmed retainers or some such thing. Since players are looking for these children, and are likely to explore every nook and cranny of the dungeon, they are probably going to encounter both of these traps. One of these traps requires the players sacrifice someone to escape the dungeon. The other summons a monster that I am guessing is meant to poke fun at people who get worked up about objectionable content in books.

A portion of the dungeon is a sort of prison for creepy monsters and I thought that was done well. The whole double door "air lock" type passageways were neat. There are two monsters to fight, though this being an LotFP module you are best off avoiding both.

_Fuck For Satan_ feels like it's trying too hard. It's supposed to be a funny fuck you to people who get worked up about the stuff James Raggi puts out. I mean, it's called "Fuck for Satan". There is a walking alien penis monster. There is a giant gay orgy. There is a monster that forces players to shit themselves, and then they have to fight their shit. The adventure feels like a parody of an LotFP adventure. I'd skip this module unless you are a collector of LotFP books. Compared to all the other recent releases from LotFP this one seems particularly weak.

**Update 2013-10-28:** This is an interesting little tidbit from James Raggi over on G+:

>The Twinkly bit from Fuck For Satan, continues to get a lot of response, and I can only assume the occasional group of players sending me character sheets is indicative of the adventure being used for actual play.
>
> Interesting how few of them are actually using LotFP stats. :D Lots of 3.x/Pathfinder, some DCC, and then a bunch that could be whatever old D&D.

Even though I feel the adventure is far more gag than functional, it is still being used in the wild. I'm curious to see how much, if at all, people tweak the adventure.
