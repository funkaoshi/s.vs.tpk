> Just another attempt for a very minimalist D&D set of rules. Please playtest and critize.  â€” [snorri, Aug 23, 2009][1]

[_Searchers of the Unknown_][2] is a role-playing game whose rules fit on a single piece of paper. I'm not really sure what the pedigree of such minimalist rule sets is, but _Searchers of the Unknown_ probably wasn't the first of this breed of game based on its tag line: "Another minimal way to play D&D". That said, it seems to be the most popular. It has spawned its own sub-genre of "Searchers" minimal D&D games. The original announcement thread on ODD74 collects some of them, such as [_MUTANT SCAVENGERS of the RUINED EARTH_][3], [_Witches of N'Kai_][4], [Re-Searchers of the Unknown][5], etc. What's interesting is that the thread has chugged along for the last 4 years. Though most of the activity came in the months following the initial posting, every so often someone would jump in to share some new mini-D&D development. This week someone posted [_Call to Adventure_][6], which looks to be another interesting take on a minimalist D&D game. If you find most versions of D&D too overwhelming, these minimal games might be your cup of tea.

**Update 2013-09-19**: Shortly after posting this I was tipped off to [_Lurkers of Carcosa_][7], which are minimalist rules for play a game set in [Carcosa][8]. That Carcosa setting book basically suggests you through away lots of the basic rules to D&D, so it lends itself well to this sort of minimalist game.
