[![This doesn't look good for the magic-user.][1]][6]

This painting is by [Yannick Bouchard][7] for the new [LotFP Referee book][2]. Is there anyone else putting out RPG art of the same calibre as [Lamentations of the Flame Princess][3]? [Their Tumblr][4] is full of amazing pieces of art work. They definitely out class Wizards of the Coast, which one would hope has a much bigger budget for this sort of thing. I often feel like all the good fantasy artists get sucked up into the behemoth that is Magic: The Gathering. It's good to see that this isn't always the case.

[James Raggi][5] sometimes gets flack for the art work he puts in his books. Sometimes people say they are too gruesome. Or they say they are too full of nakedness. I don't think i've ever heard complaints they are too boring, though.
