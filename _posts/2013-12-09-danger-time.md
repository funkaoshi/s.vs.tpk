I've been meeting up with a few of the players from the online game OD&D game I play in weekly[^1] so that we can play random D&D like games. Playing D&D online is always fun, but playing in person is still a much more enjoyable experience. Most of the games thus far have been run by Evan, who runs [Game Peices][evan]

Evan made up the rules for his game, which are based around using a 2d6 dice roll to resolve most everything. [It's a strange system.][rules] There are no hit points: when you are hit you roll a saving throw (a 2d6 roll) to see if how badly hurt you are. You can spend a 'hit die' to add its result to your saving throw. In this way you might have a better chance of avoiding being "Eviscerated". Thus far the game has had a bit of a meat grinder feel. I'm not sure if it is actually anymore deadly than a by-the-book game of D&D, but it seems that way because a character death feels a lot more binary. I lost my first character in [the inaugural session][session-1].  I lost my second character in our last session, the 3rd game we played. In fact, everyone lost their character: it was a total party kill.

There is something satisfying about a good [TPK][]. My character had been grievously wounded something like 3-4 times during the course of the session. I was basically a walking corpse, unable to do much of anything. I couldn't even carry my gear anymore. The whole party was in rough shape. We fought monsters we shouldn't have fought. Were trampled by a dinosaur. Tried and failed again and again to set some giant spiders on fire. It was all a suitable build up for our final trial, fording an underground river. We tied our characters together, because we thought that would be safe. Instead, our characters and henchmen all drowned together. It was failed roll after failed roll: someone makes it across, but is pulled back into the river by someone else who is drowning. So on and so forth till we were all washed away.

[It's a good thing making a new character takes a few seconds.][character]


[^1]: The Pahvelorn game has branched in to a few new games. [Nick][] is running an LotFP game dubbed [Dungeon Moon][dungeon-moon], that takes place on a moon that is completely a dungeon. [Brendan][] has taken a break from running Pahvelorn to run something he has dubbed the [Finchbox][].
