A term I hadn't heard before discovering [the RPG scene on Google+][1] was "Gygaxian Democracy". People will crowd source material for D&D games from the masses, often with much success.[^1] [Zak Smith][zak] seems to be the best at getting people out for these sorts of activities. Most recently, [he crowd sourced dungeon room descriptions][2]. His rules were simple: 8 words or less, don't try too hard to be clever. That's apparently all you need to end up with lots and lots of dungeon.

As I am known to do, [I turned the whole exercise into a website][3]. It keys random dungeons. Enjoy.

[^1]: Unless you've been living under a D&D rock, you've no doubt already seen [The Hexenbracken][4], [The Kraal][5], [The Colossal Wastes of Zhaar][6].
