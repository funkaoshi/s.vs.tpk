I wrote this up some time ago for a [Carcosa][1] campaign I may never run. [Brendan of Necropraxis suggested answering these questions][2] as a way to help new players quickly get a sense of what's up with your particular game of D&D. I haven't ran a game since I was a little kid, but if I did it'd probably look like the sort of games I've been playing since I got back into old-school D&D.

1. **Ability scores generation method?**

     3d6 in order, just like God intended.

2. **How are death and dying handled?**

     If your hit points drop below or are equal to zero make a Save vs. Death Ray and Poison: success indicates your character is merely unconscious, completely incapacitated until they can get a full week of rest; failure indicates your character is oh-so dead. If you roll a natural 20 on your saving throw roll, your character not only survives, but is invigorated by his near death. In this case your character re-rolls their HP for the session.[^1]

3. **What about raising the dead?**

     The ancient snake-men may have had a ritual for raising the dead, though it is currently lost to the ages. Perhaps intrepid adventurers may uncover such a spell, though I am sure the costs to cast it would make death look like the better choice.

4. **How are replacement PCs handled?**

     Roll up a new character and we will jam them into the game somehow. It's handy to have henchmen for such a situation.

5. **Initiative: individual, group, or something else?**

     Individual: roll a d6, high roll goes first, your dexterity score is used to break ties.

6. **Are there critical hits and fumbles? How do they work?**

     Yes: a 1 is always a miss, a 20 is always a hit and you deal the maximum damage for the attack. 

7. **Do I get any benefits for wearing a helmet?**

     Of course: helmets shall be splintered! 10% of hits that would damage a character will be to a character’s head. If the character is wearing a well made helmet it will shatter protecting them from the blow.

8. **Can I hurt my friends if I fire into melee or do something similarly silly?**

     Yes, targets would be chosen at random when firing into the fray.

9. **Will we need to run from some encounters, or will we be able to kill everything?**

     You will probably want to avoid some fights.

10. **Level-draining monsters: yes or no?**

     Hells no: they are the worst.

11. **Are there going to be cases where a failed save results in PC death?**

     Yes, but hopefully that won't feel stupid. What's the point of a Save vs. Death Ray if you don't have death rays in your game?

12. **How strictly are encumbrance & resources tracked?**

     Strictly! Bust out that spreadsheet, asshole.

13. **What's required when my PC gains a level? Training? Can it happen in the middle of an adventure, or do I have to wait for down time?**

     Leveling happens during down time. There is no need for special training.

14. **What do I get experience for?**

     Finding treasure, killing monsters and terrible people, freeing slaves, stopping sorcerers, exploring the wilderness and anything else I can think of.

15. **How are traps located? Description, dice rolling, or some combination?**

     Description, mostly.

16. **Are retainers encouraged and how does morale work?**

     Yes, the more the merrier. Morale is handled using the obscure rules hidden within OD&D. When a morale check is required roll a 2d6, adjusted by a retainers loyalty, the higher the roll the better.

17. **How do I identify magic items?**

    Characters may encounter ancient magical snake-men artifacts, or the great technologies of the Primordial Ones or the Great Race. Chances are *nobody* in Carcosa will know what's up.

18. **Can I buy magic items? Oh, come on: how about just potions?**

     Sorry, no.

19. **Can I create magic items? When and how?**

     It is possible, through some long lost terrible sorcerous ritual that's probably not worth the trouble when you can just go hunting for laser guns.

20. **What about splitting the party?**

     That never works out, right?
