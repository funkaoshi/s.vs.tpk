I took a particularly long lunch today to go and pick up the new [D&D Starter Set][1].[^1] I have been looking forward to grabbing it for quite some time now. [It's hard to believe that they announced 5th Edition over two years ago now.][2] The boxed set contains the core rules you need to play the game, and an adventure that helps set the tone for the new edition and hopefully helps teach people how to DM a game. I haven't ran a game since I was a little kid, so I'm thinking i'll try and run this one.[^2]

Today also saw the release of the [first version of the Basic rules for 5th Edition][3]. Wizards of the Coast decided to publish a subset of the players handbook for free, online as a PDF. What was particularly amazing is that the PDF isn't behind some weird login form or any other nonsense. [It's just there for anyone who wants it.][4] What's not to love about that?

As I've mention before, I am pretty hyped about 5th Edition. They are off to a good start.


[^1]: It's my birthday, so that seems fair. How many birthdays am I going to enjoy where there is some crazy D&D mega-event going on?
