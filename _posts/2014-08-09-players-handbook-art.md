[Basic D&D][basic] is more or less all I wanted in terms of [5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons][dnd]. It's nice and simple. Still, I wanted to give Mike Mearls and his team a high five for all the work they have done so I picked up a copy of [the new Players Handbook][phb] yesterday. One aspect of the book really jumped out at me right away: damn there is a lot of art in this thing.

The team behind 5th Edition must have blown a sizable portion of their budget on art. This thing is overflowing with artwork. It's rare to go more than a handful of pages before hitting a painting. Everything is in full colour. There is a bit too much of that "single character posing" artwork that seems to be most common in new RPG books, but on the whole I like this book's art. I wish they had credited which artists painted which pictures. Maybe that'll be something that ends up online, one day.

One nice change of pace compared to RPGs books of yore: women seem to be represented in the art more or less equally. In fact, there might be more girls than boys in this book. There's also much more variety in terms of how people are represented in general. Suck it, White dudes in armour: we're coming for you!

How was this feat achieved?

> Hire lots of women. And hire gay dudes. And hire every kind of person because they make a talented version of every kind of person. They exist.
> 
> ...
>
> That is the sole and only answer that is fair and that will get us good work while sacrificing neither of the real priorities here.

> Hire women (50%!) and let them do whatever they want. Don't hire men and tell them to make work that does not appeal to them. Don't hire a writer and ask him to write a world he will not want to play in. Hire a woman and ask her to do whatever.

[Zak Smith][zak] has [a great blog post about this (obvious?) idea][hire-women] from a couple years ago that's worth re-reading. Unless i'm bad at guessing gender, it looks like 4 out of the 6 art directors for this book were women. I can't imagine any other route to get to this book and its art that doesn't involve women being directly involved in its production.

This is good.
