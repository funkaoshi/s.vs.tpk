Cedric P's blog [Le Chaudron Chromatique][1] is full of amazing art. There is so much great stuff i'm not even sure what to point out. Their most recent post was a [lovely illustration of the Marsh Enchantress][2]. An earlier favourite of mine was this posse of [fungus monsters][3]. There's also the occasional post full of DIY D&D nerdism. Most recently Cedric reimagined Gnolls as [Hammer Goats][4]. This blog is great: check it out.
