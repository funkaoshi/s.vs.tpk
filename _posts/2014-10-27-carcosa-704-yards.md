Fungoid Garden of the Bone Sorcerer is the adventure that is included within [_Carcosa_][1]. The adventure presents a detailed look at Hex 2005, outlining several places within the hex that could be a source of adventure. If you wanted to make something like this yourself, but weren't sure where to start, Doyle Tavener has you covered. [Many years ago he started writing a guide for randomly generating these sorts of detailed hex maps.][2] I thought it was a shame his work was languishing on a long dead thread on [ODD74][3], and decided to [republish it with some nicer formatting][4]. This version has been updated by Doyle, based on running a campaign set in Carcosa recently.
