[It's been almost a year since I last checked in with all my Kickstarter projects.][report-card-iii] I continue to be a bit more wary about what I back, but mostly because I'm trying to buy fewer RPG books in general. My sense is that most people starting Kickstarter projects now are more mindful about being better prepared before undertaking them, and buyers are more cautious in general when it comes to parting with there money.

Dwimmermount's development seemed to really pick up steam this year. Updates were frequent as Alex Macris started working on editing and revising the bulk of the text in the book. So after a lot of ups and downs for all involved, I received my copy of the book in October. It's a beast of a book. [Gus from Dungeon of Signs has written a thorough review of the thing.][dwimmermount-review] Domains at War also arrived at the end of the summer, which I think clears Autarch of all their crowd funding obligations.

[Champions of Zed][15] and [Appendix N Adventure Toolkits][13] are still running behind. I suspect i'll get them when I get them. So it goes.

[James Raggi][lotfp] still owes me a few more books, though I have a bunch on the way from Finland as I type this right now. I'm sure he wants to tie up all these loose ends as much as I want him to. As I mentioned last time, the fact everything he produces transforms into something much more fancy by the time it makes its way to me certainly helps stifle any frustration I may feel here.

Several kickstarters I backed since my last report have already shipped. [LotFP Free RPG Day 2014][7] and [No Salvation for Witches][1] from LotFP wrapped up on time. (Though NSFW ended up shipping their physical books late to coincide with the release of a Red and Pleasant Land and the other new books from LotFP.) [Servants of the Cinder Queen][4] arrived on time and was a lovely little adventure. The physical copies of the two DCC RPG modules I backed are still being put together, but they grew in scope due to stretch goals. I don't expect them to be particularly late, and I have PDFs of many of the books already. And of course [Scarlet Heroes RPG][6] by Kevin Crawford would arrive on time.

The only big miss for myself this year has been backing [The Great Kingdom][3]. The project looks amazing, but has been sued by the people making another D&D documentary. God damn it.
