> Carcosa is not Tolkien, high fantasy, or mainstream fantasy. It is equal parts horror, science-fiction, and swords & sorcery. It is H. P. Lovecraft’s *At the Mountains of Madness*, Robert E. Howard’s “Worms of the Earth” and “A Witch Shall Be Born,” Lin Carter’s “Carcosa Story about Hali,” and Michael Moorcock’s “While the Gods Laugh.” — _Carcosa_, pg 3

I have read almost none of the source material that inspired [Carcosa][1]. As I am now in the middle of [running a campaign set in that world][3], I thought I should try and remedy that—if only so I can better understand what a Cyclopean City might look like or what the hell a Primordial One is all about. Since we live in an age where you can basically ask anyone anything, I thought I'd go right to the source and ask [the author][2] what specific books he recommends one read to get in a Carcosa frame of mind:

> Of the pure Lovecraft stories, read these:
> 
> * The Call of Cthulhu
> * The Whisperer in Darkness
> * At the Mountains of Madness
> * The Shadow over Innsmouth
> * The Shadow out of Time
> 
> Of Lovecraft's revisions, read these:
>
> * The Mound
> * Out of the Aeons
> 
> Read the original five Elric stories by Moorcock:
>
> * The Dreaming City 
> * While the Gods Laugh 
> * The Stealer of Souls 
> * Kings in Darkness 
> * The Flamebringers (later retitled The Caravan of Forgotten Dreams)
> 
> Read R. E. Howard's:
>
> * Worms of the Earth (a Bran Mak Morn story)
> * The Shadow Kingdom (a Kull story)
> * A Witch Shall Be Born (a Conan story)
> 
> If you can find Cthulhu Mythos stories by Lin Carter, read those.

Hopefully someone else will find this list handy. It seems like a good fantasy reading list even if you aren't interested in Carcosa.
