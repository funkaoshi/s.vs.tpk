I have been using ascending AC for my OD&D Carcosa game. Players roll a d20 to hit, add their attack bonus, and try and score higher than their opponent's AC. An unarmoured combatant has an ascending AC of 10; plate armour and a shield confers an AC of 17. It's a much simpler system for adjudicating combat in my opinion. People know if they have hit or not without having to look at a table, and the arithmetic is all quite straight forward.

What follows are the tables from the first OD&D book _MEN & MAGIC_ redone so they work with ascending AC. (I am certain I am not the first person to do this, but there wasn't an obvious hit when I looked on Google.)

The attack bonus progression for the Fighters is:

| Level | Attack Bonus |
|-------|--------------|
| 1–3   | +0           |
| 4–6   | +2           |
| 7–9   | +5           |
| 10–12 | +7           |
| 13–15 | +9           |
| 16+   | +12          |

For Clerics:

| Level | Attack Bonus |
|-------|--------------|
| 1–4   | +0           |
| 5–8   | +2           |
| 9–12  | +5           |
| 13–16 | +7           |
| 17+   | +9           |

And for Magic-Users:

| Level | Attack Bonus |
|-------|--------------|
| 1–5   | +0           |
| 6–10  | +2           |
| 11–15 | +5           |
| 16+   | +7           |

Monsters use the following table.

| HD       | Attack Bonus |
|----------|--------------|
| up to 1  | +0           |
| up to 2  | +1           |
| up to 3  | +2           |
| up to 4  | +4           |
| up to 6  | +5           |
| up to 8  | +6           |
| up to 10 | +8           |
| 11+      | +10          |

The tables are simple enough to make. In a descending AC system a first level characters needs to roll a 10 to hit AC 9 (an unarmoured person), which we determine by looking at the attack table in _MEN & MAGIC_. To hit that same character who has an ascending AC of 10 by rolling a 10 (or more) implies a 1st level character has no attack bonus. A 4th level fighter only needs an 8 to hit that same character, so their attack bonus is +2.
