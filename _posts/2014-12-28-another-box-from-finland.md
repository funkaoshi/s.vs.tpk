![LotFP Box from Finland](/assets/img/lotfp_box.jpg)

People, this box! This is the box I have been waiting for. If you could only see my full-body sobs for joy.[^1] All the way from Finland comes another box of goodies from [Lamentations of the Flame Princess][lotfp]. Because I have backed so many LotFP [Kickstarters][] I somehow ended up with 4 extra books beyond the 2 I ordered.  I will probably write about each in more detail shortly, but I thought I would say a quick word about the books after flicking through them really quick.

As I have mentioned previously, there is no one I am aware of anywhere else in the RPG scene make books as nice as James Raggi, including all the big name publishers: Wizards of the Coast, Paizo, etc. *A Red and Pleasant Land* has tiny print run compared to the new 5e books, but is comparable in price and is physically a much nicer book. The paper is nice thick and matte, and the binding of the hardback is actually signature stitched. (It's disappointing how many hardbacks nowadays are essentially casebound books with hard covers.) *A Red and Pleasant Land* is actually nicer than the Penguin Classics reissue of *Alice's Advneture in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass* that I recently purchased—and that book is pretty nice itself! All of the recent LotFP books are produced with a level of care that now seems to be lost in most of the publishing world.

Beyond book fetishism one can also appreciate LotFP books for their art. There is obvious effort put into sourcing good and interesting art. I can't say I'm always a fan of the choices Raggi makes, but there is never a piece of art in his books that feels phoned in. His books have much nicer covers than most modern fantasy novels, and certainly most RPG books. Of this recent batch of books, I love the cover of *No Salvation For Withes* the most—the interior art is too gross and terrifying for me sadly.

I love books. It's refreshing to see there are still people out there who love them as much as me.
