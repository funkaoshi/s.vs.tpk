I've had to start making dungeons for my players to explore. Unsurprisingly, that's something that comes up with some frequency in a game called Dungeons and Dragons. There is lots of advice on this topic from people much smarter than myself, which I now collect conveniently in one place for your edification as well as mine.

 * [Dungeon Design and Stocking - with examples!][doe] — Gus from Dungeon of Signs has a very thorough post outlining how he makes dungeons in a "naturalistic" way. He tries to imagine how the dungeon might end up in the state it is in when the players show up. He isn't a big fan of funhouse dungeons and an over reliance on randomly stocking things.
 * [Map Design Thoughts][doe-2] — Gus, being the hardest working man in the OSR, also has a blog post taking a look at how he approaches creating maps for his games in the first place. The discussion about map size and complexity as a form of time management is interesting.
 * [Nitty Gritty of Dungeon Design][ase] — Patrick Wentmore, author of ASE, has a very mechanical approach to dungeon design, that feels like an interesting contrast to Gus's approach.
 * [Random Dungeon Stocking][delta] — Related to the above, Delta provides a good overview of the random stocking rules from the various editions of D&D.
 * [Old School Dungeon Design Guidelines][grognardia] - Grognardia offeres up some good advice on designing a dungeon with that sweet old school feel. 
 * [Megadungeon Practices][mp] - Dreams of the Lich house gives a good overview of the things to consider when building a megadungeon you expect to be the main source for adventure in your game.
 
I do things like Patrick Wentmore. I have a little program that spits out what should be in each room using the rules from the Moldvay basic book. I'll then try and think up what each "monster", "monster + treasure", etc might be. I'll sometimes shuffle things around, or place important monsters or treasure ignoring the suggestions from the random rolls. Oftentimes it is fun trying to figure out how things might fit together, what the unguarded treasure might be, etc.
 
No doubt there are countless more posts on this topic out there. What do you suggest someone look at for inspiration or ideas?
