[*Night Witches*][night-witches] was released to the public a few days ago. The game was produced as the result of a successful [Kickstarter][]—like most games nowadays—and has seemingly [been in the works for years now][history]. The game caught my eye because it features artwork by [Rich Longmore][longmore], the illustrator of [Carcosa][]. $12 for a PDF of new Rich Longmore art feels like a steal. The fact there was a whole game that came with it was a nice bonus. And so it came to pass I bought my first [story game][storygames].

*Night Witches* is a game with a very specific focus. Everyone plays Russian fighter pilots from the all women [588th Night Bomber Regiment][588th], who the Nazis referred to as the Night Witches. I play in several D&D campaigns right now and they are all over the map when it comes to setting and tone. House rules might differentiate the games slightly, but for the most part we are all playing D&D. People in the D&D scene will add or drop rules to shift the focus of D&D slightly. Someone into dungeon crawls will focus on light and encumbrance rules. Someone interested in horror might introduce sanity rules. These sorts of tweaks seem minor when you look at a game like *Night Witches*. The whole game exists to support this very niche experience.

The game play in *Night Witches* is fairly straight forward. Play is split into two phases: days and nights. During the day you role play the action that happens on the airbase. At night you fly bombing missions and try to kill nazis. *Night Witches* is based upon the rules for [*Apocalypse World*][aw]. Action is free-form until you do something that would require you making a *Move*. These are the pivot points in the game. Moves are specific: you *eyeball* someone or *act out*. There are a handful of moves each character can perform. The analog to characters classes in D&D are natures in *Night Witches*: someone has the temperament of a *hawk*, or an *owl*.  Natures grant additional moves characters can learn as they level up. In this way the game feels similar to 4th Edition, with its discrete list of powers. I’m curious if this feels as stifling as [I found it with 4th edition][4e]. Are players who are good at *eyeballing* going to constantly try and give everyone cut eye to get their way? (Maybe I just played 4e with goofy players.)

Night Witches seems to be first and foremost about collaborative story telling. At least, this is what it seems like coming to the game from D&D. I’m curious if all the bonuses you collect and moves you have are in fact far “gamier” than they sound on paper. There is probably a tactical element to succeeding in your air missions that is more evident in play. (Not that i’m particularly interested in that sort of thing. I like playing OD&D because there are barely any rules.)

In Night Witches characters each have 4hp (marks), and when you use them all up you are dead. The way this works sounds similar to the Grind in a Torchbearer. You get progressively more stressed and injured, culminating in your passing. Character death looks to be the likely outcome for most characters in a long running campaign. My *assumptions* about story games were that this sort of thing was uncommon. (In contrast to the meat-grinder D&D games I have become used to.)

There’s a lot to like about the rule book. The book is well laid out, both in terms of how it looks and how it functions. It opens with advice on where you should start reading, based on your experience with table top games and Apocalypse World games. The start of the book has all the player facing rules. The middle of the book has the rules the GM would need to run a game. There is advice on running your first session, how to teach people the game, etc. Most of the rules for the game fit on the character sheet. (Again, something that was common in 4th Edition, and apparently how all the Apocalypse World inspired games work.) I suspect it'd be easy to use the book during play.

The new artwork by Rich Longmore is fantastic. I have no regrets about picking up this book. My only gripe is that there isn’t more Longmore art. The other artist featured in this book is Claudia Cangini, who did head shot style comic portraits of women from the 588th Night Bomber Regiment.

I still haven’t played Night Witches. I’m not sure when i’ll get the chance. Hopefully sooner rather than later: it seems neat and it’s certainly different.

*Update 2017-03-13*: [I ended up playing Night Witches twice at BreakoutCon 2017.][nwr] It was really great.
