Overall I am quite happy with how Kickstarter has been treating me. Most of my recent Kickstarters have delivered without a hitch. [Reaper Bones][10] managed to ship a bajillion minis without breaking a sweat. Goodman Games shipped [Peril on the Purple Planet][6] and [The Chained Coffin][8] more or less when they said they would, with lots of bonus goodies. I've got the PDF of [The Stygian Garden of Abelia Prem][4] without any fuss. Overall, projects seem to be better run and handled now.

It wouldn't be a Kickstarter update if I didn't mention i'm still waiting for books from [LotFP][]. That said, James Raggi has sent me so many random adventures and bonus books the wait doesn't feel particularly onerous. Of the 4 books funded in the LotFP Summer Adventure Campaign, each has grown in scope and [awesomeness][]. As I've mentioned before, more project creators should follow Raggi's lead with respect to how he handles projects that are off the rails.

In contrast to LotFP, we have [Brave Halfling Publishing][13]. I don't have anything to say here that hasn't already been said elsewhere.

[Champions of Zed][15] arrived, finally, about 3 years after it was funded. If there is one Kickstarter I regret backing this would be it. I don't want to belittle someone's hard work, but this project feels so thoroughly half-assed.
