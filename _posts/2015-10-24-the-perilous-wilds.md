![The Perilous Wilds and Friends](/assets/img/perilous-wilds.jpg)

[*The Perilous Wilds*][wilds] by Jason Lutes is a supplement for [Dungeon World][dw] that expands upon that games rules for wilderness travel. This is the part of D&D I enjoy the most—it’s the bulk of [my Carcosa game][carcosa]—so the book was of interest despite the fact I don't play Dungeon World. The best RPG books are those that are useful beyond the games they are intended for.

The book borrows from what I would call the [Vornheim][] aesthetic. There are random tables galore. The writing is terse, but evocative. The layout is smart: spreads are assembled with care and thought as to what rules, writing, and images appear together on each set of pages. This sort of attention to detail is rare in RPG books.

The art work is all black and white line art by cartoonist Keny Widjaja. The art is very retro, reminiscent of the sort of art one finds in old Basic D&D and early AD&D modules and rule books. There are lots of small illustrations throughout the book.

The book introduces new rules and mechanics to Dungeon World games for travel, making camp, scouting, etc. These could be moved whole hog into a game of D&D. My plan is to do just that in my Carcosa game. The mechanics of Dungeon World are quite simple: roll a 2d6 and you either succeed, succeed with a complication, or fail and face a tough complication. You could model all reaction rolls in D&D on this formula, I suppose. The rules taken together add a structure to wilderness travel that feels lacking in vanilla D&D, and is apparently glossed over in Dungeon World.

There are rules for using retainers that are interesting, with lots of random tables for helping you quickly roll some up. I am also thinking of using these rules in my D&D games to differentiate PCs from their hired help. Often times retainers in my game end up being extra attacks for the PCs and someone to suck up damage from monsters. The rules here would turn interacting with your retainers into a little bit of a mini-game, I suppose, in the same way wilderness travel becomes its own mini-game.

There are pages upon pages of tables in the book to help you come up with a wilderness encounter. Their are tables for generating settlements, monsters, dungeons, discoveries, etc. I plan to use them in a game I am sharing DM duties with here in Toronto. (In my Carcosa game the results for many of the tables don't make as much sense.)

An additional supplement produced as part of the Kickstarter that resulted in this book, [*Freebooters on the Frontier*][fotf], may get me playing Dungeon World. It looks and feels like OD&D Dungeon World—the characters are more fragile, your choices for classes pared down to the core four, and the goal of the game is straight up looting treasure. It seems like a pretty straightforward game to play: my favourite. 

Also pictured in the photograph above is [*A Book of Beasts*][bob], which uses the monster generation rules in The Perilous Wilds to produce a small bestiary. The monsters are neat, but it's probably more useful as an example of how to best use the tables from *The Perilous Wilds*.

I have been looking forward to this book since it was first announced. I had pretty high hopes for what would be produced, and i’m quite happy with the results. If you are interested in hex crawls and the like this book is well worth grabbing.
