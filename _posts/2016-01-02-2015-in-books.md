At the start of the year I had a goal to buy no more than one RGP book a month. This is less about money and more about actually making sure I have the time to really sit and enjoy the books I buy: it's easy to collect RPG books for the sake of collecting. Anyway, I didn't really come close to my goal. (I actually did worse than the previous year I tried this experiment.)

The bulk of what I buy continues to be books from the OSR for use with D&D, but there were a few exceptions. I grabbed [*Ryuutama*'s][1] PDF when it was put up for sale, and then quickly upgraded to a hardcover. The game looks like an SNES manual, and doesn't remind me of any other RPG I've played. I backed [*The Warren*][2] on Kickstarter because I thought Bully Pulpit's previous game [*Night Witches*][3] was well done. That book arrived at the end of the year and looks to be the game about rabbits I didn't know I wanted to play. I finally bought [*Dungeon World*][4], after enjoying [*Perilous Wilds*][5] so much.

There are lots of cool zines and small modules being put out by individuals in the OSR now. [*A Pernicious Pamphlet*][6] and [*In the Woods*][7] are stand out examples of this sort of work. I am hoping to make a zine from bits and pieces of my [Carcosa][8] game this coming year.

I only bought one book from [Wizards of the Coast][9]. The stuff they put out isn't really of interest to me. I wish they had an indie-imprint doing more interesting work. [*Out of the Abyss*][10] is an enjoyable read, but it's also large and cumbersome, and I can't imagine actually using the book to run a game.

If you were curious what books are in the running for The Ramanan Sivaranjan Awards for Excellence in Gaming for 2015, here you go:
