The day has finally arrived: [Original Dungeons and Dragons is available for sale as PDFs][0]. These are PDFs of the booklets that were re-created for the [collectors boxed set][1] that came out last year. (There were older scanned versions of these booklets available for sale several years ago, and those PDFs were pretty terrible.)

My biggest gripe with OD&D was not with its rules, writing, or art, but with its cost. The game is now a collectable, and has been for some time. The collectors edition Wizards of the Coast made last year is around $100-$200 depending on where you look.. That's about $15-$30 per staple bound booklet. (Well, you get a nice box too.) If you want to try and track down the originals you likely can't find them for that "cheap" unless the books themselves are in a state no collector would want. Original boxed sets are usually several hundred dollarsâ€”if you can find one that has survived this long. Forget all that: now you can just print your own!

As I have no doubt mentioned on my blog several times now, [OD&D][2] is my favourite edition of D&D. At the time it came out I really can't imagine using these books to figure out how to play D&D. Lucky for you it's 2016! It's easy to back-fill any holes in the rules with rules from the Basic D&D rules produced by Holmes or Moldvay. OD&D is a fun starting point for your own variation of D&D.
