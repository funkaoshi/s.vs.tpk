Ennies voting has come and gone. What are these books even? As is often the case I find their picks lacking—in other words I don't recognize them. The Ennies are the Teen Choice awards of the RPG scene.

It feels strange writing about books from a year ago in the summer of 2016, but here we are. [The Ramanan Sivaranjan Awards for Excellence in Gaming][0] need to follow some rules, otherwise what’s the point?

What follows are my favourite books of *2015*. To qualify for contention your book must have been purchased by myself in 2015 (and ideally published in that year as well, but I honestly don’t give that many fucks about that). Winners were chosen all by myself, based on my feelings about gaming at this moment in time.[^1] As you read on you might say to yourself, "Ram: these categories are totally different than last years!" Yeah, they are. If you want consistent award categories the Ennies have you covered.

## Best Setting Book:  David McGrogan for [*Yoon-Suin: The Purple Lands*][ys]

![yoon-suin](/assets/img/yoon-suin-award.jpg)

_Yoon-Suin: The Purple Lands_ takes _Vornheim’s_ approach to world building—copious random tables—to an extreme. Rather than describe Yoon-Suin David McGrogan shows the reader how to create their own version of his world. The setting itself is comprised of several regions, each interesting and unique in their own right. *Yoon-Suin* could have been 4 or 5 books, but instead it is a single epic tome. The scope and vision of the book is incredible, and is as unique as the world it describes. 

(I would be remiss if I didn’t call out Matthew Adams and the wonderful art he has provided for the book. One of the few complaints I have with the work is that there isn’t more art from Adams.)

## Best Not D&D: Jason Lutes for [*The Perilous Wilds*][pj]

![Perilous Wilds](/assets/img/perilous-wilds-award.png)

*The Perilous Wilds* is Dungeon World crossed with all sorts of OSR inspiration. I love hex crawls and wilderness exploration in my D&D. This book is a nice focused look at the subject, coming at the topic from a completely different direction than i’m used to. 

There is a fair bit of Basic / Expert D&D in the tone and feel of the book, and also in how the book has been laid out. B/X was very smart when it comes to presenting information, and was seemingly ignored as a design to copy. Well, people copy the trade dress while missing what actually makes it compelling. Perilous Journey’s isn’t so foolish. Almost everything in the book is a tidy spread. It's a pleasure to flip through and use. A lot of thought has clearly gone into making it useful in a fast improvisational game.

## The Ramanan Sivaranjan Excellence in Gaming Best God Damn Book of 2015: Scrap Princess and Patrick Stuart for [*Fire on the Velvet Horizon*][fotvh]

![Scrap tells you to shut up about stats.](/assets/img/scrap-on-stats@2x.jpg)

*Fire on the Velvet Horizon* is unlike any other D&D book I've read or seen. It is a monster book without stats, a coffee table book you can use in your D&D game, some sort of new-wave fiction. Stuart's writing is captivating and thoroughly weird. Each of the pages in the book, produced by hand by Scrap, is a piece of art. There are some stand out examples of her “she’s just scribbling god damn it!” style. Seeing so much of her art in one place, and stuff in colour, it really nice. As I've said before, there is nothing else like her artwork. 

This book is such a great example of two people following their own artistic vision without letting anyone else get in their way. *Fire on the Velvet Horizon* has the airs of something art-house, but once you dig in it is clear it was written with an eye to towards the gaming table. The book is thoroughly uncompromising in every way.[^2]

## Honourable Mentions

[*The Chthonic Codex*][1], [*In the Woods*][2], [*The Hell House Beckons*][3], [*The Warren*][4], and [*Ryuutama*][5] are excellent books I enjoyed. [*A Pernicious Pamphlet*][6] is particularly excellent, and had a ‘best zine’ award in several drafts of this blog post.[^3]

Till next year. Booyaka! Booyaka!

[^1]: This blog post has been a draft for months now. I knew fairly early on what books I wanted to call out, but it has been agonizing trying to pick one book over another for the big award. That said, in my heart I probably knew who the winners were the moment I read their book. One of the biggest reasons this was a hard choice was that Patrick won an award last year and I was worried these awards were just going to be “Ramanan’s annual blog post where he tells Patrick he’s awesome.” And now the mother fucker wrote *Maze of the Blue Medusa* so I am already stressed for 2017—pressure is on everyone else. Still, you should win if you are doing good work. Every scene needs their Daniel Day-Lewis.
[^2]: Including how small they were willing to typeset the text.
[^3]: I want to limit myself to calling out three books a year. Maybe that’s dumb, but I think focus is good. I hope people don’t think my Honourable Mentions are also rans. These are all really stand out books in my mind.
