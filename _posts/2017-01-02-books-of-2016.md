While 2016 might have been one of the shittier years in recent memory, it was seriously killing it when it came to RPG books. I continue to mostly read books coming out of the OSR. My favourite publisher remains Lamentations of the Flame Princess: they had a stellar year. [Maze of the Blue Medusa][motbm] was finally released and it's so beautiful it's unreal. Like last year, I did end up buying some "indie" games: Burning Wheel's fancy new books], and some interesting looking Apocalypse World games, including [the original game][aw] itself.

I buy a lot of RPGs, but managed to buy nothing from Wizards of the Coast. I feel like they are leaving money on the table by not catering to a wider variety of tastes with their work. They need an indie imprint. 

I buy stuff when stressed and it's clear I was stressed at the tail end of the year. I ended 2016 with far more books than I had planned to buy. My attempts to limit myself to a book a month has been one of my less successful projects.

If you were curious what books are in the running for [The Ramanan Sivaranjan Awards for Excellence in Gaming for 2016][awards], here you go. This is going to be a *really* tough year to pick a winner.
