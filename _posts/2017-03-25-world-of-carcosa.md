> Players, don’t get too attached to your characters, because the game isn’t about them—the game is about the warren. Individual rabbits are cheap and the continuity of the warren is everything. Death is explicitly on the table and will occur as the fiction demands, so breed early and often. Your kits are your legacy (and the pool from which you will probably draw your next character).
>
> Think of the game as a generational saga rather than an heroic narrative. Although your characters may well be leaders, poets, and scofflaws, they are still at the bottom of the food chain in a world determined to kill them. Perhaps their children can finish what you so bravely started. Generational play is great fun, and having a strong connection to the warren as a living community pays great dividends over time. You’ll start to care about its health and goals, and build a mythology around the exploits of previous generations. And, despite all these lofty assurances, in the end making up a new rabbit takes only minutes. - Marshall Miller, *The Warren*.

[*The Warren*][2] is a Powered by the Apocalypse game about rabbits—picture Watership Down.[^1] I've tried to play it a few times with my daughter, though without much success. My daughter is a scaredy cat. She doesn't like games with conflict or danger.[^2] Most RPGs aren't particularly interesting without either.

*The Warren* is full of writing I could imagine being pulled right out of an old-school D&D book. Stories about rabbits are often stories about survival and horror. Watership Down is very much in this vein. Your rabbits struggle against the world, and many will die so others may live. One can picture running some real meat grinder games playing a by the book game of *The Warren*.

I've wanted to run a session of this game with people closer to my age for a while now. Bully Pulpit Games has published several "playsets" (basically very terse setting documents) to help kickstart games of *The Warren*. They're all quite good, but sometimes it's fun to make your own.

> Of course anyone can do anything he likes with Carcosa. There is no One True Wayism about Carcosa, nor is there an "Official" Carcosa. My attitude towards my creations is that of Gary towards D&D in 1974, not Gary towards AD&D in 1982. — [Geoffrey McKinney on Dragonsfoot][1]

[World of Carcosa][3] is a playset for *The Warren* that is set in the doomed world of Carcosa. If you have been reading this blog you know it's one of my favourite settings for D&D. I'm not sure what the Venn diagram is for people interested in Carcosa and people interested in a game about rabbits. Perhaps it's very small. This is for my people!

I haven't had a chance to run this playset yet. Buyer beware!

[^1]: You are no doubt already familiar with *The Warren* as it was awarded an Hounorable Mention in [the Ramanan Sivaranjan Awards for Excellence in Gaming, 2016][4].
[^2]: A brief recap of one of our games: "I thought my daughter might like a game about rabbits. She was sent out for carrots and narrowly avoided an owl! That was too scary, though, so she decided she'd just play the predators and the rabbit she made is now a turncoat working with the humans after eating a soup that made her evil." A few weeks later I tried playing with her again: "In this session she is searching for cutie rabbits to also convert to evil. She also travels in an invisible bag carried by her human friend so foxes and owls can't get her."
