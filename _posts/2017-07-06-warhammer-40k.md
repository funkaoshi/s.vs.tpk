I hadn't given [Warhammer][1] much thought since junior high. Back then my friend had bought a starter set and some minis for an orc and goblin army. We played elves and humans versus orcs and goblins for several weeks, but ultimately that all petered out—no one else had the money for miniatures at the time. By the end of junior high we all got into magic and that became our (somewhat cheaper) money hole of choice. All throughout high school I would joke about wanting a [Blood Thirster][2] for my single unit Chaos army, but that was the extent of my interest in Warhammer.

Last week I walked into [The Sword and Board][3] and bought the new Warhammer 40,000 starter set, Dark Inperium.[^1] This is their first product that introduces the new 8th edition of the game. I saw the set the week prior and it had been on my mind since. I’m not sure why. It’s a very cool looking box, I suppose. To quote [Patrick Stuart][4], "The thirst is real."

Dark Imperium was expensive ($190 CAD!), but in the grand scheme of Games Workshop a good deal. The set comes with 53 miniatures that make up two armies, a Space Marine Imperium army and a Death Guard Chaos army. It also comes with everything else you need to play: the new hardcover rule book for 40K, two mini "codex" books that describe the armies that come in the set, a smaller card stock printing of the core rules, some dice and a range ruler. Everything about the set is nice and fancy.

As a beginner boxed set goes this one is crazy. You open up the box and are presented with another box. It features a cool picture of a space marine on its cover: amazing. But wait, that box is full of sprues! Like, a terrifying amount. What the shit? The rule book opens with a very short introduction to the Warhammer hobby and then it's like 150 pages of lore: "in the grim darkness of the far future there is only war," and all that nonsense. The rules for actual Warhammer 40K are buried 2/3rds into the book. (They are a modest 12 or so pages out of this almost 300 page book.) There are instructions for how to make the models in a separate booklet, though nothing about the finer points of modelling. There isn’t any advice on painting. There isn’t any sort of quick start guide to get you going with the game. Perhaps that makes sense: there isn’t anything quick about this hobby. Probably best not to give anyone any false impressions.

I made the first model sitting on my deck, a space marine. That model, along with the other space marines, were fairly straight forward to assemble. All the models seem well thought out in how they are sculpted and disassembled for manufacture. There are little nubs all over to make fitting everything easy. The models are generally designed so that they hide seams and joints when put together. I’m curious how much the aesthetics of Warhammer are shaped by the nature of these little gaming pieces.[^2]

It took me a week of modelling here and there to get all the minis built.[^3] They are sitting on a bookshelf now waiting to be painted. I'll report back when they are painted or I've played a game. Hopefully that's soon—so this purchase wasn't entirely foolish.

[^1]: An impulsive purchase. (Of course.) I had to wake up at 8:00 AM that day to help one of our clients upgrade their install of the software I work on, and it was this really complicated sort of gong show that lasted 5-6 hours. So, it was a bit after lunch time when it was all done, and I just felt like buying something to calm myself down and feel good. It was a real "treat yourself" moment. I probably should have just had a beer. It'd have been much cheaper.
[^2]: [Thankfully Patrick Stuart has already written about miniatures so you don’t need to read my hot take on the subject.][5]
[^3]: [I was "blogging" about my week with Warhammer secretly on Google+.][6] My thoughts about building the models and reading the book are buried in the comments of a post about the DCC RPG Free RPG Day adventure. I felt a bit embarrassed about my super bourgeois purchase.
