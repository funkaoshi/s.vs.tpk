Previously I had made a half hearted attempt at painting my Reaper Bones miniatures. I found Reaper's meagre advice on the subject and my attempts at painting lacking. I painted a handful of minis before putting this new hobby aside. (We call that half-assing it in Canada.) A couple years later and I find myself with [with 53 new miniatures to paint.][1] That’s a lot of plastic. I don't know why I thought things would be different this time.

Painting your miniatures seems to be an important part of the Warhammer scene. Tournaments often require your miniatures are painted to a particular standard. People don’t want to play someone whose minis are all grey plastic. (I suppose painting helps identify what’s what on the table.) My Warhammer minis looked amazing and cost me enough money I didn’t want to fuck them up. This was a real quandary. Conveniently, my friend [Evan][2] is an amazing painter and spent his youth as a Warhammer nerd. He offered to come over and help me get started.[^1]

[Evan came over one Sunday with a bag full of spray paint and we got to work priming.][3] Games Workshop has a house style that is very structured in how you go about painting minis: prime, shade, layer, layer, layer, highlight, highlight, highlight, etc. Their magazines are full of minis that are so vivid and detailed, they often look like cartoons. Evan suggested a different approach: paint as much as you can with spray paint because ain't nobody got time to paint that 4th layer of anything.

We started with the Space Marines. They were primed with black spray paint. Once dried, we did a light coat of grey sprayed from above, and then followed that with red painted in much the same way. This left the minis looking like they were being lit by moonlight, or emerging from the shadows.[^3] They were interesting without anyone having to take out a brush. The Death Guard followed. With the base coating done, I was left to figure out what to do with all the details.

At first, I just painted everything that was supposed to be black, black. This turned out to be easier than I thought. Emboldened I started painting parts of their armour metallic. And so on and so forth. I’d pop into [The Sword and Board][4] to pick up paints I was lacking and work on some new detail. I realize now that paint is to Warhammer what booster packs are to Magic: The Gathering—a cheap way to throw money down a hole.[^4]

Painting a miniature is quiet and relaxing work.[^2] You need to be patient to produce a mini that looks good. Over the last couple weeks, I've managed to make my way through most of my Space Marine army. Some units are "done". Others are quite close. I don’t think I'll win any contests, but they are painted to a standard I didn’t think I'd be able to accomplish. I didn't think I would enjoy painting, [but here we are][5].

[^2]: While painting I find it hard to do anything besides focus on the task at hand: keeping my hands steady. I’ve found painting a good way to clear my mind.
