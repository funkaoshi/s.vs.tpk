The competition for my time and attention (and money) grows fierce as indie publishers and amateur authors continue to push out better books than the big names in RPGs. We are in the middle of an RPG golden age. I found it particularly challenging this year to narrow down the list of books I wanted to call out, and harder still to pick the three for that most special of distinctions.

This award exists in contrast to the Ennies, the RPG scene's Teen Choice Awards. The Ennies are lovely, i’m sure, but they are very much a product of letting a bunch of randoms vote on what’s good. Sometimes they pick what you like and you think, “man, these awards are great.” Sometimes they pick something you’ve never heard of and you think, “what is even the point of this thing?”[^1]

To be considered for an award a book must have been purchased by me in the previous calendar year. So the books below are all from 2016. (Remember 2016? All the famous people died and Americans elected Trump for their president.) That's basically the only rule.

## Best Art: Jeremy Duncan for [Towers Two][tt]

Jeremy Duncan was tasked with finishing up the art for a book originally done by Gwar’s David Brokie. That’s no easy feat. Brokie’s cover is amazing, but Duncan’s interior art ratchets everything Brokie was doing up to 11. I had previously described the art as “bright, colourful, messy, detailed, crude, psychedelic, cartoonish, gory and intense,” and reviewing the book today I feel the same way. It's so vibrant and unique. I just picked a random image from the book for this blog post. I could have grabbed any. They are all so totally nuts.

## Best Setting Book: Rafael Chandler for [World of the Lost][wotl]

This felt like a quiet release for Lamentations of the Flame Princess. It was stretch goal for another adventure James Raggi published, *No Salvation for Witches*. While I liked NSWF just fine, I loved *World of the Lost* more in every way. It seems a shame it hasn't garnered more attention and praise. *World of the Lost* is such a well engineered hex crawl. The book is so well organized. The layout is fantastic. Everything about the book is in service of a really interesting and evocative setting. It's full of useful random tables and generators. Running an adventure from this book is easy. This is such a solid release it’s a shame its print run was so small.

## The Ramanan Sivaranjan Excellence in Gaming Best God Damn Book of 2016: Patrick Stuart & Zak Smith for [Maze of the Blue Medusa][motbm]

I thought picking Maze of the Blue Medusa for this award would be easier than it turned out to be. There were so many great books in 2016. World of the Lost and Towers Two were both out before Maze of the Blue Medusa and both captivating in their own way. By the end of the year there were several more books that stood out, most notably Broodmother Sky Fortress. But the heart wants what the heart wants.

I love *Maze of the Blue Medusa*. The writing from Patrick is excellent. Like his other works it feels like a mix of game text and post-modern fiction. You can read *Maze of the Blue Medusa* and enjoy it as a book full of lovely writing, or use the book as it was intended to run a crazy adventure. The layout of *Maze of the Blue Medusa* is stellar.[^2] Everything about how the book has been put together is designed to help orient the dungeon master in the dungeon. Zak’s map that brought the project to fruition is beautiful, and the art of the map is scattered throughout the book. Finally, the book itself feeds into my love of a well made book. Satyr Press made the nicest book I bought in 2016. Easily. Maze of the Blue Medusa is everything I love about RPGs in one place.

## Honourable Mentions

[Apocalypse World 2e][aw], [The Black Hack][bh], [Blood in the Chocolate][bitc], [Broodmother Sky Fortress][bmsf], [The Cursed Chateau][cc], and [Do not let us Die in this Cold Winter][cw] are all excellent books well worth checking out. Lamentations of the Flame Princess deserves a special mention for managing to publish so many great books in a single year. Finally I want to give a special shout out to Cecil Howe’s [HexKit][hk], which I fucking love.

Till next year. Booyaka! Booyaka!


[^1]: Wait—what's the point of *this* thing? Patrick’s won something 3 years in a row now. ([I actually made an off hand remark about this very situation occurring last year.][last-year]) We're half way though 2017 and *Veins of the Earth* has come and gone, which made picking this years awards tougher. I can see into this award's future: I can't imagine not Veins not making my short list next year. That made me second guess my picking *Maze of the Blue Medusa* for awards this year. There is likely something structurally problematic in how I construct my [long list][long-list]. I'm always going to buy Patrick's new book: I love what he does. So, he's always guaranteed a spot in my long list. (Well, until he starts writing dreck.) I pick up all of LotFP's adventures for the same reason, so they are overrepresented in my long list and have a better chance of making it to my short list. Should I penalize people for making good books, though? As I said last year, every scene needs their Daniel Day Lewis. In 2016 I picked up a lot of games from people i've never heard of, for systems I would have never played, so it's not like i'm knee deep in the same people's work, but this is still something to keep in mind. At the end of the day this award will always simply be a reflection of what I like. I mean, I named them after myself.
[^2]: I still think the rooms are a bit too wordy, but you can’t praise someone for their prose and then complain there is too much of it.
