I bought the new edition of [_Necromunda_][Necromunda], Game Workshops miniatures skirmish game about gangs in the 41st millennium. How did I even get here?

> I don't imagine anyone else I know buying any of this stuffs, so I might just treat this starter set like a (god damn expensive) board game and leave it at that. I think there are enough people in Toronto I can scam into playing with me. (Evan being the most obvious.) When I asked my wife if she'd play Warhammer 40K if I bought the boxed set she said "no", but the way she said it was, "no—you fucking idiot of course I won't play it." My cousin lives down the road and is a gamer nerd. Will report back on just how dumb a purchase this was in a few months.

These were my thoughts after opening the box to [_Warhammer 40,000: Dark Imperium_][di], the new boxed set for the Warhammer 40K game. This was a year ago, give or take. It was a gift to myself for having to deal with a crazy client upgrade at work. I don’t really remember why I was so fixated on this particular boxed set. I had seen it the week before, and in a moment of stress went off to buy my own copy.

> I don't imagine anyone else I know buying any of this stuffs …

I was wrong. Warhammer is like smoking. You never really quit. 

Evan helped me get started with painting, and then quickly fell back into the game. He still had a Tau army, which we played our first game of this new edition with. He then sold it off for store credit at the shop so he could start a new Adeptus Mechanicus & Imperial Guard army. (His units are all kit bashed and crazy—really quite amazing.) We would meet to play games of 40K every few months, depending on our schedules.

What’s funny is that people who don’t live near me also got sucked back into Warhammer, likely due to my incessant posting in [my secret Warhammer 40K G+ thread][secret]. I chat with Patrick (from [False Machine][fm]) often about Warhammer 40K, and in the time we started talking he went from sitting on the side lines to buying and painting up a cool Rainbow Warriors Space Marine army. I’m not sure if I should feel good or bad about that. A few other G+ gamers will chime in to talk about Warhammer. 8th Edition looks to have helped get a lot of people back into the game.

> … I might just treat this starter set like an (god damn expensive) board game and leave it at that …

I was wrong. Warhammer is a giant money hole. 

Between *Dark Imperium* and *Necromunda* there has been a lot of minis. I ended up enjoying the building and painting part of the hobby much more than I thought I would. So, I quickly started spending money so I would have more things to paint. (And eventually started spending money when I had things half painted. Like some sort of idiot.)

> … Will report back on just how dumb a purchase this was in a few months.

I mean, Warhammer is expensive, so in that regards it was stupid to decide to get into the hobby. On the other hand, I do build and paint and play with the miniatures. Warhammer more or less supplanted much of the gaming I did in 2017 and thus far in 2018. It has become my nerdy hobby of note. I have come to love Warhammer a lot. So, a year later I'm going to say this wasn't a dumb purchase.

I've written up several play reports now of the games Evan and I have played at the Sword and Board, from [our modest skirmish sized battles][pr1] to a big [3-person game with my wife's friend Devlin][pr2]. 8th Edition is an excellent version of the game. It's quite straight forward compared to what I remember playing when I was a kid—though I might just not remember Warhammer Fantasy very well. I have heard complaints the game is too random and not strategic enough, which is likely fair, but I wouldn't say that's had much impact on how much fun i've had playing. There have been so many fun and funny moments in the games I've played so far.

Now I need to organize a Necromunda campaign.
