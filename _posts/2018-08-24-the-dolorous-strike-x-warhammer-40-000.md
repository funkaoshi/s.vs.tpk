Now that I am basically a full on war gamer I was happy to see that OSR superstar [Emmy Allen's][emmy] latest endeavour was a skirmish game. [*The Dolorous Stroke*][tds] is [inspired][] by *Inquisitor*, the Lord of the Rings skirmish game, Arthurian stories, and [Dark Age Of Sigmar / AoS28][aos28] kit bashed miniatures. I am down for all of that.

I have a few miniatures from *Kingdom Death* that might work in this sort of setting. I could likely make a neat Dark Souls inspired knightly retinue. The game has a really lovely implied setting—which I will now ignore for the rest of this post. I have a ton of Warhammer 40,000 miniatures, and I'd really like to use them with these rules.

Emmy provides a ton of advice in her game about how to make your characters. For each stat she outlines what reasonable numbers should be. She provides various examples for different types of characters so you can get a sense of what a scholar knight or a monk or an acrobat might be. Using a model's stats from 40K as a guide it shouldn’t be too difficult to use the rules of *The Dolorous Stroke* to play games set in the Grim Darkness of the Far Future.

In 40K we have the following stats for a character: Movement, Weapon Skill, Ballistics Skill, Strength, Toughness, Attacks, Wounds, Saves, Leadership. We can use these as a guide to creating characters for *The Dolorous Stroke*, whose attributes are: Speed, Accuracy, Prowess, Strength, Toughness, Wits, and Education. 

Movement maps to Speed and we can more or less use the value as written. 6” movement in 40K is quite common, but in Emmy’s game it seems like 5” is closer to the norm. You should probably subtract 1” from most 40K characters Movement attribute to get your new Speed score. (Note that this may make some characters—like Plague Marines—particularly slow.)

Ballistics Skill maps to Accuracy and Weapons Skill to Prowess. In Warhammer you roll over your skills on a d6. A Ballistics Skill of 3+ (like that of a Space Marine) would be equivalent, more or less, to an Accuracy of 6. Here we use Emmy’s advice that you are usually trying to roll low on a d8. The way you roll with your Prowess stat in combat differs from how your Weapons Skill is used in 40K, but I think it’s reasonable to map scores the same way.

| BS/WS | Rough Accuracy/Prowess |
|:------|:-----------------------|
| 2+    | 7+                     |
| 3+    | 6                      |
| 4+    | 5                      |
| 5+    | 3-4                    |
| 6+    | 1-2                    |

Strength and Toughness serve the same purpose in both 40K and *The Dolorous Stroke*, though the way the numbers are used differ. Emmy suggests you use the value of 4 or 5 for a typical human. In 40K most human characters have a Strength and Toughness of 3. Space Marines have a toughness of 4. Plague Marines a toughness of 5. Numbers of 6 or higher are usually reserved for giant robots, tanks, dreadnoughts, etc. I think I would map things as follows:

| 40K S/T | TDS S/T |
|:--------|:--------|
| 2       | 2-3     |
| 3       | 4-5     |
| 4       | 6-7     |
| 5       | 7-8     |
| 6       | 8-9     |
| 7+      | 10      |

Characters that have multiple attacks in 40k (an Attacks score greater than 1) should be given combat abilities in *The Dolorous Stroke* that highlight the fact they are proficient fighters. Characters with high Leadership scores may also deserve some skills to highlight that—like the aptly named Leadership skill for example.

A characters Saves attribute in 40K is usually an indication of how good their armour is, or some hint at their natural resilience. Space Marines generally have a score of 3+, with Terminator Armoured characters or heroes being given 2+ saves. The lighter armour of a Guardsmen is usually a 5+ save. These numbers can be used as a guide when deciding the bonuses of the armour in *The Dolorous Stroke*. I would treat a Guardsmen as having +1 armour (Light Armour) while a Space Marine would be +3 (Heavy Armour and a Helment).

The last two attributes in *The Dolorous Stroke*, Wit and Education, don’t map to anything in 40K. You should likely use your judgement here, based on how you imagine your particular character.

All characters in *The Dolorous Stroke* can take at most 7 hits before they die (as you lose 2 Blood cards per hit). You will likely die sooner because of injuries or other circumstances. To represent characters who have more wounds in 40K, you may want to give them skills that limit the ways they lose blood or take injuries.

I would treat Psyker’s in 40K as Magic-Users in *The Dolorous Stroke*. You can re-skin existing spells or make up new ones as required. In 40K a Psyker risks danger when they manifest powers from the Warp. I would tweak spell casting in Dolorous Strike so that drawing an Ace or a King results in possible peril from the warp. The most straight forward thing to do is have the Psyker lose some number of Blood cards. If the Psyker dies you should have the units around them affected by the turmoil of the Warp. Maybe they explode. Maybe a demon erupts from their body.

I would simply re-skin existing weapons in *The Dolorous Stroke* for your 40K characters, using their existing Weapon Profiles from 40K as a guide. You can represent weapons that do more damage in 40K by having them result in the loss of more Blood cards. *The Dolorous Stroke* is straightforward enough that coming up with bespoke weapons should be easy enough.

I haven't actually tried using any of these suggestions in a game. I haven't even played *The Dolorous Stroke* yet! At first glance it looks to be a very cool game, and I suspect a lot of people will be talking about it sooner rather than later. I'll report back if these ideas work out or not. (Or, maybe you can tell me if they worked for you.)
