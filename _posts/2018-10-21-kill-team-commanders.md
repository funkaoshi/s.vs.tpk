I picked up [*Kill Team Commanders*][ktc] over the weekend, despite my better judgement. It’s a small boxed set (a rule books, some cards, and some tokens) that add rules for fielding stronger “commander” units in your games of Kill Team. If you’re on the fence about this expansion, here are my quick thoughts:

* It's 100% not worth whatever they are charging for it where you live. It's probably a smarter move to pay the extra $50 and get the Rogue Trader boxed set that comes with all those crazy minis—but doesn't have all these new rules.
* No matter, because there are hardly any new rules of note: the rule book is basically a codex of commander units for all the original *Kill Team* factions. You can probably imagine what rules for fielding a command might look like, and they’d be close to what Games Workshop has published in this expansion.
* So, if you are bored of regular *Kill Team* and want some new units to muck around with, there are a bunch of them fleshed out for you.
* There is a lot of recycled artwork. Perhaps all of it?
* Commanders can pick up new specialisms unique to them, which are flavourful. If you give no fucks about balance you can use them in your narrative campaign with your random fancy kit bashed miniatures.
* There are 12 new missions, which I am always a fan of. (Though, they are mostly commander friendly variants of the missions in the original book.)
* It comes in a surprisingly nice box. I assume this is what you are paying for. The box fits the new rule book along with the original one.

If you’re wondering why I reviewed this expansion before reviewing *Kill Team* proper, i’m wondering the same thing. I love *Kill Team* and have too much to say about it, I suppose. Now that’s a boxed set worth buying.
