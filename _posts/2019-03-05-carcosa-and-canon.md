For a little over a year I ran a biweekly OD&D game set in the doomed world of [Carcosa]. My goal was to play up the more silly and gonzo setting elements of Carcosa: the aliens, mutant dinosaurs, etc. Carcosa was the first setting I encountered that some how managed to communicate what it was all about, while leaving so much up to the individual GM to figure out. 

One day I will make a zine for my Carcosa game, and when I do it'll open with these quotes.

> I have always been reticent about answering questions about Carcosa. There is no Single Ideal Carcosa to which other referees' Carcosas must conform. I tried with Carcosa to lightly sketch (but in lurid colors) a weird world of nightmare. I want to awaken feelings of the weird and of horror and of awe with Carcosa, such that the referee can then use Carcosa to satisfy within himself and his players the deep desire for darkness and the weird.
>
> I shudder to think of rules lawyers or canon lawyers playing their tricks with my books. The books are meant for the opposite use, the use of creative and imaginative referees who basically say when reading my books, "Ah, I see what you're trying to do here. Let me finish all your sentences for you." I never want to effectively tell a referee to sit down and shut up. — [Geoffrey McKinney on ODD74][1]

> Of course anyone can do anything he likes with Carcosa. There is no One True Wayism about Carcosa, nor is there an "Official" Carcosa. My attitude towards my creations is that of Gary towards D&D in 1974, not Gary towards AD&D in 1982. — [Geoffrey McKinney on Dragonsfoot][2]

> My words do not even pretend to be Official Carcosa. There is no such thing as "Official" Carcosa. There is only YOUR Carcosa. Do with it as you will, and may the Old Ones mutate your thoughts into an indescribable campaign. — [Geoffrey McKinney on Dragonsfoot][3]
