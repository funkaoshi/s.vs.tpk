[Scott Malthouse][scott], the author of [Romance of the Perilous Land][perilous], started a cute thing on Twitter where he encouraged people to share retro gaming books from Britain with the hashtag [#BOSRâ€”British OSR][bosr]. It's fun seeing pictures of old Games Workshop books and art, Fighting Fantasy, Russ Nicholson art, etc. [I posted a picture Grail Quest][grail], a serious #BOSR deep cut. But, what if the #BOSR was the Brazilian OSR?

I'm not sure how I stumbled on the OSR scene in Brazil, but it's there and it feels like it's having a moment. I think I started following the artist and designer [Diogo on Twitter][diogo] first. He's made [several games][oldskull] and will share his work in progress artwork. He also shares the works of other people in the scene, and slowly I have found more artists and designers working out of Brazil making games, or doing graphic design and art.

I picked up [Pacts and Blades][pacts] first, by [Lucas Romlin][lucas]. A minimalist RPG for you to play Moorcockian inspired fantasy stories. I don't think I need more RPGs, but this one has stunning graphic design, and makes effective use of public domain art and paintings. Lucas tweeted about his friend [Guilherme Gontijo's][gontijo] game [Into the Bronze][itb]. Gontijo was the graphic designer for Pacts and Blades, and this game shared its sharp design. I saw he was [using Hex Kit to make funky maps][hexkit] and was obviously intrigued. Into the Bronze is a complete reimagining of Into the Odd as a game for playing Sumerian's during the Bronze Age He has lots of games that look interesting, but I must pace myself!

The next thing I picked up was [Escape from Station 52][escape], a solo card game, by [Emanoel Melo][emanoel]. I don't think my printer is nice enough to print the cards, but it looked cool. Again, I'm not sure who shared the game with me, but I shared it joking I could get far just tweeting about Brazilian games. Emanoel tagged their friends in a reply, and I learned of the artist's [Bakto][] and [Alex Damaceno][Alex]. Alex is redoing Keep on the Bordlands, one page at a time, and [the results look amazing][b2].

Alex shared the work their friend [Victor Amorim][victor] was doing, calling it Hollow Knight crossed with Into the Odd. I love Hollow Knight, and know many other gamers that enjoy that video game, so I let them know this game called [Carapace][] exists. A friend replied, "Carapace has the most direct built in RPG goal I've ever seen (without being something like Lady Blackbird): you are getting Marble to build a cannon to shoot a Marble Titan." It's true! 

Who knows what I am missing. I don't speak Portuguese. There is likely a whole world of Brazilian gaming I haven't seen or found yet. Still, it is interesting for me in Toronto to have this small window into what's happening far from my home. Hopefully for you too.
