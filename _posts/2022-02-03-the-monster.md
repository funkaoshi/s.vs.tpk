Every so often Nate will pop into the discord we're both in to chat about his super-high level D&D 5e game: [it's totally bananas and inspiring][nate]. He made this off hand remark about _the_ Red Dragon in his game:

> The red dragon Vlaurung lives in a palace in space and is the consort of Tiamat.

One of my favourite parts of Dark Sun was that there was a singular Dragon: it made the monster more mythic in my mind. [Sean][] felt the same way about making monsters unique: 

> I feel like almost any game could be made better by taking the monster manual and just writing *The* before every monster.

And then Brendan reminded us that he figured this all out many years ago: [Sui Generia][sg].

Some creatures feel like they maybe aren't as nice a fit for this treatment, your D&D mooks: kobolds, orcs, goblins, etc. Alex suggested "the Goblins being a single band of six (6) named assholes is as good as if not better than a monolithic Goblin." Chris followed up, "I feel like you could have The Kobold, but still have a Kobold society that he's built down in the mines with stolen children or whatever and the kids all paint themselves blue and make shitty traps or whatever else kobolds do." I love it.

This feels like such a simple and compelling way to create a unique setting from a collection of very common elements. You could pick 10 of your favourite monsters and create a unique world for you and your friends. These conversations always have me thinking about running OD&D again.

I didn't want this conversation to disappear into the ether that is random peple on a random discord, so here we are. Blogs are for remembering.
