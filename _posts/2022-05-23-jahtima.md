[Jahtima][], a new book in my mail via [FourRogues][]. (Between them and [Ratti Incantati][] my RPG spending has become … well more, anyway. No regrets!) I saw book and was intrigued: an RPG about hunting monsters in early “medieval” Europe, which is currently what I am interested in. The graphic design is quite pretty or bold at times, but maybe also gonna give you a headache? This isn't a novel, though. Maybe a headache is fine if you can find the page quickly.
