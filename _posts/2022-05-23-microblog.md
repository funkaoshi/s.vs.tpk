This is a little bit of an experiment. This post is what some might call [micro blogging][]. If you're reading this in an RSS reader it'll look the same, but on my website this post is displayed a little bit differently. It should look a bit demure next to a bigger grown-up blog post. 20 years ago a lot of blogging felt short and casual. Nowadays it feels like people feel the need to say a lot, and find friction in the format. People move their casual messages to sites like Twitter or Facebook. But the ephemera you post online should belong to you as well. With the death of G+ I saw so much great stuff just vanish. So many messages from friends, interesting discussions, etc. Some of it lives in an export on my hard drive. A lot of it's likely gone forever. So maybe i'll try and post the stuff I care a bit more about here. And probably on Twitter too.
