[You should check out this name generator from Elijah Mills][1] which I discovered on [the NSR discord server][2]. This is pretty fantastic. As he describes it: "I made a post-apocalyptic name generator for an upcoming collaborative project. We combined 200+ names from the Iliad and Odyssey with hot-rod terminology to get some really whacky results that are perfect for our setting."
