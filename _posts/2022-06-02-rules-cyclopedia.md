As I have discussed in the past, I got started with D&D playing with the [Rules Cyclopedia][1]. When I went to buy my own D&D books I ended up grabbing the AD&D 2nd Edition Players Handbook instead. I didn't realize the games were quite the same, and assumed I'd want the "advanced" version anyway. Iâ€™ve wanted to track down the Rules Cyclopedia for ages, but they are often hard to find or collectables. Alex, a player from my recent Torchbearer game, was given two copies by a friend of his. He asked the group off hand if anyone wanted one. Of course I do! So he mailed it off to me. What a lovely thing to do. And it's here now, and I am awash in nostalgia.
