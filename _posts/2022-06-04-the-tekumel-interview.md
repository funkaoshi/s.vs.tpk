Thanks to Sean McCoy we can enjoy this interview with [James Maliszewski about Empire of the Petal Throne][1]. They cover a wide range of topics. "I wanted to talk to James about Tekumel, long campaigns, Barker and his tainted legacy, and where true ownership of an RPG setting lies." Tekumel is such an unusal setting. Seemingly so thoroughly divorced from your typical tolkien rooted fantasy. [James ran several sessions of Empire of the Petal throne for the TorontOSR peoples][2] before embarking on his epic campaigns, a fun experience.
