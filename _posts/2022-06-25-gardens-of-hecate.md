I was visiting [my local game store][4] and saw an art book featuring the work of Ana Polanšćak, the woman behind the incredible blog [Gardens of Hecate][1]. As part of the [Inq28][2] scene, Ana produces some really unique and moody miniatures and war gaming ephemera. [The art book][3] chronicles her journey through the hobby, and is a real deep dive into her whole process when it comes to producing her work. A lot of the book is about how she thinks about world building, and is likely of interest to RPG nerds. There is a lot of overlap between narrative war gaming and RPGs, and Gardens of Hecate is the perfect example of that.
