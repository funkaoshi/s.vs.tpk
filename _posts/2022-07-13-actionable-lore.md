Mateo over at Hex Culture has written a great post about how to make the lore of your setting more interesting and actionable for your players. [He discusses an idea called Situational Narrative Design.][1] Richard jumps in with a related discussion on how to make the player's characters central and impactful in the wider world they play within: [The PCs are a Faction][2]. Finally Emmy has a nice short post on [Environmental Storytelling][3], "using objects and locations in RPGs to tell a history or fiction".
