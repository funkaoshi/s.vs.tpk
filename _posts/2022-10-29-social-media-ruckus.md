I suspect [the death of Twitter][1] is greatly exaggerated. No one pays 44 billion dollars for something only to drive it into the sun, though that's honestly the best outcome one could hope for when it comes to Twitter. I've been on that site since the dawn of time—I'm twitter user 3,321—and I will be a little sad to see it go, but honestly not *that* sad. It's been dreadful for many years now. 

Just to get a little bit ahead of any exodus, here are a few places you might see me besides this blog:

- [Mastadon][2], which honestly kind of sucks. It's like the Linux of social media. And I don't mean that as a compliment. But, at least we can trust it to chug along while not selling your data to advertisers. I'm on tabletop.social, but another popular choice with open registration is [dice.camp][4].
- [Cohost.org][3], which seems promising, but I am unsure how they plan to keep the lights on. It reminds me a bit of G+, in that you can create public (or private!) "pages" for people to follow, and you write posts with comments: no stupid threads.

At the end of the day, the OSR is about blogging, and I'm always up for more of that.
