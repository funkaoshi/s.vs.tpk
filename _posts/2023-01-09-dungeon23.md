[Sean shared a pretty cool project on Twitter][3], which has really blown up: [#dungeon23][1]. The idea is simple: grab a day planner and write a dungeon room a day. At the end of the year, you'll have a Megadungeon. I love it! Not enough to do it, of course, but I have been enjoying seeing what people produce. If you decide to start this endevour, [I suggest you follow Sean's advice][2]: keep things simple and have fun. Treating a project like this as if it was your second job is a recipe to give up by March.
