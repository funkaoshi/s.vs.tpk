My boy Nate--the man running what sounds like the greatest 5E game ever--[reviews one of the greatest video games ever, Elden Ring][1]. I am a huge fan of Elden Ring, and plan to write about it one day. (I liked this game a lot. Nate's feelings are a bit more thoughtful, nuanced, and mixed.) There is so much you can steal from that game for your games of D&D. If you have a PS5 I would strongly recommend you check it out.
