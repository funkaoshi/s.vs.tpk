[BreakoutCon][] is this weekend. Sadly I will miss it, i'm out and about, but I did manage to meet up with some friends last night, before the convention began in earnest. It was a bit of a G+ reunion. [Zzarchov][] drove down from middle of nowhere Ontario. [Richard G][] drove up from Upstate New York. We rounded out the posse with some [torontOSR][] regulars: myself, Brendan, Alex, and KYANA. What a crew! KYANA gave everyone G+ buttons she made. An advantage of meeting up with Zzarchov is you get to see what he's been up to in the flesh. He had new reprints of several of his books, including one of my favourites, [Scenic Dunnsmouth][]â€”a true classic of the OSR. The book was kickstarted as part of [the Kickstarter for City of Tears][ks]. It still features Jez's amazing art and layout. I assume you'll be able to buy it soon. This is me giving you notice to start paying attention to [Neoclassical Games wesbstore][ngr].
