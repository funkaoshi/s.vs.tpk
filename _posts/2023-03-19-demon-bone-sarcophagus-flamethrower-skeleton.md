Patrick could have given this monster a dumb fantasy name, but like a true professional tells you what it does on the box.

[Demon Bone Sarcophagus][dbs] seems a little intimidating to me. There is lots going on within this book. Lots of text to kick things off. Lots of text throughout. It all feels quite dense. Scrap mentioned that a lot of the text in the book is there to help orient the DM to what's going on, to make it an easier adventure to run. Fair enough: let's read this thing!

The book opens with a bunch of backstory that's all tucked away in one place, so you can just skip past it like a true Patrick Stuart fan. The book doesn't jump straight to the dungeon, but presents its bestiary first, like Veins of the Earth. The bestiary doubles as a nice dramatis personae for the module. Adventuring through the dungeon looks like it'll involve a lot of mucking about with NPCs and so learning about them upfront is a good idea. Everything you need to know about the NPCs in monsters is consolidated in one place, but if there are interactions between the creatures and the dungeon, that information is repeated in the room descriptions as well. As was the case with the secend edition of [Deep Carbon Observatory][dco], this book is broken down into (mostly self contained) spreads. You should be able to run the adventure from the book without a lot of faffing about. In theory, anyway. I'll report back once I've run this thing.

I've been reading the book on and off this weekend, making it through about half the book. Sometimes I have big plans to write about these books I like, but never get around to it because I have too much to say and the weight of figuring out what to write is too much. This time around I will share thoughts as they come to me.
