I picked up [Luke Gearing's][lg] adventure for the [Best Left Burried][blb] system, [Behind Closed Doors][bcd]. It was also waiting for me in my brother's flat in London. If you were looking for something with some strong old-school Warhammer Fantasy RPG vibes look no futher. The players are given license to hunt down witches, and are set off into the world to do just that. There are some witchy things going on, but no overarching plot to this sandbox adventure. There its lots of love in this book. There is a creepy castle that feels straight out of a good LotFP adventure. There is a powder keg of a town that ends the book that would likely be a lot of fun to play through. The book looks like it'd be a bit challenging to use: I felt the urge to take notes as I was reading. There is lots going on: places to go, people to see. I'd be interested to run this with a system like Dogs in the Vineyard. This feels like it should be a more notable adventure than it seems to be. It feels like some very good OSR nonsense. I would check it out.
