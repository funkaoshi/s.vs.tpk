I had shipped several books to my brother in UK, one of those was [Gangs of Titan City][gotc]. I don't think it's unfair to say this is a Necromunda RPG with all the serial numbers filed off. The RPG is what I'd describe as OSR,  but you can see the influence of games like Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark. The game has a clear structure to play, starting with an escalation phase where you figure out what's going on and prepare for your operation, an operation phase where you'll play out the action of your chose mission, and finally a fallout phase where you see how your actions have changed the larger world, tally XP, etc. There its lots of support in the book itself to help you start your campaign and keep it going. The mechanics of the game are quite simple, familiar to people who have played any PbtA game: you roll 2d6 and add an attribute modifier to see if you succeed. There are no predefined moves, you'll pick the modifier you use based on the action you're trying to accomplish. The game looks interesting. I'd be keen to try and work in using minis as part of play.
