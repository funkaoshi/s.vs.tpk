![Break 2017](/assets/img/break-2017.png)

A million years ago Rey started talking about a game he was working on called [_Break!!_][break], I suppose building on top of the ideas began in his OSR setting [Baroviania][]. Back in 2017 Grey or Rey sent me an early draft of the game, but it was so full of stuff I honestly thought the games release was imminent. Honestly i'm sure they did too. But no! The years ticked by and I was worried this game would never happen, as Rey improved the rules or Grey improved the layout and art. This game is such a creative vision of what an RPG can be. Everything i've seen over the years is so beautiful and feels so fully realized. I've been hyped for this game for years now. Many of us have. [Now they are ready to take your fucking money.][break] The game's already funded. It happened in minutes, apparently. And why not? This game is going to be amazing.
