[Chris recently shared a draft of a war game set in Bastionland.][bb] It's a simple war game, where he looks to be experimenting with squads of random starting strength and the sort of grotty mood of [Turnip28][t28]. I thought some of the ideas he was trying out looked interesting, and decided to give the game a go.

I have [Warhammer 40,000][40k] miniatures, so I'm going to play a Warhammer 40,000 game.

_Necrons awaken to find their tomb ship amalgamated into a Space Hulk, now adrift in the warp. The Sons of Horus have been fighting aboard this ship for weeks, months, years and millennia, all at the same time. The two groups are jockeying for control of a safe haven within the hulk._

I set up a spaceship board with a room in the centre. I had objectives in each corner and one in the middle. The game would end when one side controlled the central objective and two other objectives for two turns in a row, or one side was wiped out.

I needed a few additional house rules for this scenario to work:

- Opening or closing a hatch door costs one Order Dice. If the OV of the Order Dice is 4+ you can also move 3" before or after opening or closing the hatch.
- Claiming an objective costs one Order Dice. Objectives remain under a warband's controls until claimed by the other warband.

Here are some highlights from the game:

- On the first turn I rolled that no additional Terminators would fill up the 2-man Terminator squad, while one of the Tactical Marines squad had all its units arrive as reinforcements.
- On the Necrons turn I rolled a 1 again for reinforcements: the Overlord would be alone the entire game.
- On one side of the board a Sergeant and his Tactical Marines were in a firefight with a Royal Warden and their Necron Warriors. The game is quite deadly: if someone shoots at you it's hard to avoid losing a unit. With reaction dice letting you fire overwatch as a unit moves out to shoot at you, there was a lot of picking off each sides squads. In the end, over a couple turns, the marines came out on top.
- In the middle of the board, the Prateor and Terminator were up against a Necron Overlord. The Overlord used a reaction dice to take out the Terminator moving up to try and engage him. The Royal Warden moved up and opened a hatch, shooting and killing the Praetor. He was then killed by the Tactical Squad.
- The marines had the central objective and the two on their side of the board. There was on another squad of Necrons, untouched this battle, but they couldn't get into the fray fast enough. The Space Marines won the game.

The active player has 4 order dice they can spend to perform actions with a squad, the other player gets 2 they can use to react to the active players moves. I would usually focus most of my orders on a single unit, as you can't move that far if you're only moving d6 inches. You also need to manage the negative status effects you collect as you move and shoot, which also takes an order. In practice the game felt like it was using alternating activations. The pace and flow of the game is quick. The action moves between the players at a real clip.

It's very easy to kill units: perhaps too easy. I probably need a board with more cover. Though, perhaps all the death better simulates the closer quarter combat of my Kill Team Space Hulk board.

This is a very early draft of the game. I am curious where it will end up. I'm not even sure Chris will pick this game up again any time soon, he has so many other games on the go. Till then, we have a fun skeleton of a game to play.
