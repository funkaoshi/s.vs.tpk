My current obsession is the 2021 edition of Kill Team. [This game is probably most famous for using shapes to represent distances][1], but not having those distances have anything to do with the shapes used. How many inches do you think a square represents? If you said 4" you'd be wrong, it's 3". You might be asking yourself, why wouldn't you use a triangle for 3". Well, they had already used the triangle to represent 1". For reals. Anyway, this is a big tangent, because the game is actually loads of fun when you give it a chance. I've been playing it over the last month or so at the other local game store, [Negative Zone Comics][2], and been having a really great time. It's more complicated than [Warcry][3], but feels like it'll be manageable once you have more games under your belt. The core of the game feels fresh and interesting, rather than simply re-skinning 40K. Fighting in close combat is a simple dice game of trading blows or parrying. Shooting is complicated by marking models as concealed versus engaged. The various Kill Teams have really flavourful rules. I'm hoping to play a short campaign with Evan, and will write up more thoughts once that's done.
