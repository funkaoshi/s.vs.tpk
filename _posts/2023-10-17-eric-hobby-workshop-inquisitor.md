[Eric's Hobby Workshop takes a look at one of Game Workshop's craziest games, Inquisitor!][1] The video is a great overview of the game if you aren't familiar with its whole deal. Eric managed to track down a bunch of 54mm models from the range which he's built, painted, and shown off in the video. [It's been a few months since I last mentioned Inquisitor.][2] I should write about my own experiences with the game. One day.
