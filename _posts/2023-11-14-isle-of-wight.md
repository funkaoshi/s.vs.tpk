Michael, of [Trilemma][2] fame, has started running [a zombie survival game set on the Isle of Wight][1]. The game takes place at the end of the cold war turned hot. The players are all crew of the cargo ship BF Fortaleza. I managed to join in for one session, and hope to make some more in the future. I love Zombie World, as you all ay now, but [the system Michael cobbled together][3] for his game worked really well. I think it illustrates neatly how you can really jam a bunch of ideas together and make something compelling enough. (I hadn't encountered the encounter move from The Regiment before, and it seems like something everyone should steal for their games.)
