[Patrick][0] turned his blog into a giant bible sized book: [_Speak, False Machine_][1]. I have the [more modest PDF][2], which I have been reading on my iPad here and there. When Patrick told me he wanted to make this book I thought him a bit mad: "who wants an absolutely beastly book of blog posts?" I thought. The scope of this thing is kind of incredible. Reading it now, though, I can see the appeal of this format: it's a much nicer way to read his writing. There is some slight rearangement of texts to form more of a cohesive narrative of sorts through his posts. I had forgotten some of his earlier posts, like his gaming with "the teenagers". The new art work he commissioned for the book is great! There is no reason not to grab the PDF, and if you love False Machine the big book looks amazing.

Now that _Speak, False Machine_ is shipping, he has moved on to getting [his Wodlands setting turned into a proper book][3]. Once again he's found a great artist to work with. This project is looking great, and so obviously good I don't really understand why it isn't more wildly successful. (Well, probably because Patrick refuses or fails to do all the things people do when running Kickstarters, I suppose.) [The original Wodlands posts are on his blog][4], for those who want to read them before throwing your money at the computer screen. I am looking forward to this book a lot.
