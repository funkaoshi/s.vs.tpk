I love this: [nicer warband and campaign sheets for The Doomed][1], aka Grimlite from [traaa.sh][2]. If you haven't seen traaa.sh before, it's such a well designed blog. They always post useful stuff. So this is really par for the course. Evan and I have been playing The Doomed recently, continuing our epic multi-system neverending Warhammer 40,000 campaign. I'll have to write about those games soon. [I have been tracking everything in Google Sheets.][3] Looking at these sheets gives me ideas for how to tweak my digital set up, though I like the idea of writing things out on paper. That feels more legit.
