I am a man with too many hobbies and interests, but [James’s lovely ode to OD&D][fountainhead] has me thinking about the game once again. Some of the longest campaigns I’ve ran and played in have been [OD&D][odnd] games: impressive for a game that came out 6 years before I was born. The 50th anniversary of D&D is this year. I suspect we’ll see a lot of writing about the game over the coming months. For example, here is a great post from Gus that looks at the history and design of the earliest D&D dungeons: [The Underground Maze or Primordial Stack][umps]. Something worth revisiting this year is [Philotomy’s Musings][pm] by the enigmatic Jason Cone. A lot of the modern thinking about OD&D feels like it comes directly from his writing about the game. I plan to re-read the OD&D booklets: it’s been a while.
