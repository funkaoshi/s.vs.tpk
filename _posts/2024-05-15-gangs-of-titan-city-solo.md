[Alone in the Labyrinth talk about their solo campaging of Gangs of Titan City.][1] I've had the game city on my bookshelf for some time now. I still hope to get it to the table one day. It sounds like my local gaming club is getting into Necromunda, and that might be a good spingboard for some Necromunda themed RPGing. [I wrote a little bit about the game when I picked it up from my brother in the UK.][2]
