I enjoyed this post from Ty over on Mindstorm, where he takes Jason Cordovaâ€™s [Paint the Scene][pts] idea and tries to jam it into OSR gaming. [_Collaborative Worldbuilding: Glimpses_][1] is all about sharing elements of world building with your players. Mindstorm puts out consistently good blog posts: well worth adding to your RSS feed.
