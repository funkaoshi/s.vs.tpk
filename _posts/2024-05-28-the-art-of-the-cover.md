[Clayton takes a look at what elements make for a compelling cover, highlighting some of my own favourite books in the process.][1] This post was likely sparked by Wizards of the Coast teasing the cover of the Player's Handbook for the next update to D&D. The cover is pretty boring and uninspired, but I think at this point Dungeons & Dragons doesn't need a fancy cover to sell itself. It is Transformers to everyone else's Gobots. The new D&D cover tells its fans, "don't worry, this is more of the same."
