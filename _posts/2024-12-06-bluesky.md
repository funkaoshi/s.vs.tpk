[BlueSky][] feels like it's having a moment. I'm on the site using my domain as 
my username, [@save.vs.totalpartykill.ca][tpk]. When Google+ was a thing, I
would just link my posts there, and use that space as my comments. That really
bit me in the ass. Anyway, let's do that again. If you reply to [my link
to this post on BlueSky][1], it should show up as a comment here. Shoutout to 
[Matt Kane / ascorbic][mk] for making this set up easy to do. I'm not sure if
something like BlueSky can capture all the things that made Google+ great. 
Being able to actually comment on someones post, and nothing be constrained to
some character limit really encouraged a lot of interesting collaboration. Still,
it feels like there is a lot happening on that space recently.
