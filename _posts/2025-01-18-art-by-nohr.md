G+ died in slow motion. There were redesigns people hated.  Tweaks and changes throughout its life, as Google tried to make it work the way they wanted. The site was shuttered in April 2019.  The social network was never the hit Google wanted, but it was a weirdly popular RPG space—certainly the epicentre of the best parts of the OSR for a period of time. People never stopped posting, right up until the end.

I remember seeing pictures of Mörk Borg in the dying days of G+ and knowing I wanted it despite not knowing what it even was. Despite it being written in Swedish.

There is lots of love about Mörk Borg, but I believe a large part of its success is due to the bananas art and graphic design of Johan Nohr. [Clayton Notestine has written at length about what makes Mörk Borg’s graphic design so fantastic][layout], so I don’t have to. I get annoyed when people are dismissive of Mörk Borg’s graphic design. You can flip to the back of the book and see the adventure Johan laid out: neat, tidy and functional. Clearly he could have made the whole book like that if he wanted to. The excitement on the page is a choice. I digress.

Johan has produced a lot of art for the RPG scene since my first encounters with his work. He did the graphic design and art for [Into the Odd’s fancy edition][ito], showing the world he isn’t a one trick pony. He did the graphic design for [CY_BORG][cyborg], showing the world he can make something that feels cohesive with Mörk Borg, while managing to be its own thing. He’s painted countless covers, pictures of dogs, pictures on cardboard. The man keeps himself busy.

[_Art by Nohr_][art-by-nohr] is a chonky coffee table art book, collecting work from 2006 to 2023. The book was published via one of those kickstarters I backed without really thinking about any of the costs. [I paid so much money to ship this book to my actual house. ][dhl] A heart breaking amount. If you know me you know I don’t ship fucking nothing to my house, shipping makes me crazy. I have books waiting for me across the globe, one day I’ll see them. But this book I was too hyped for.

The book is massive and beautiful. The sort of book you want to lay flat on your dining table and flip through slowly. As I write this post it’s sitting next to me, but I find I don’t actually have anything interesting to say. I love the intensity of Johan’s art. It’s interesting to see 20 years of work in one place. What else is worth talking about? The book is sitting on a shelf next to art books for [Anders Zorn][zorn], [Mary Cassatt and Helen McNicoll][mchm], and [Denyse Thomasos][dt]. He keeps them good company.

I love Johan’s art. Maybe you to do? [If so, it’s time to blow some money.][art-by-nohr]
