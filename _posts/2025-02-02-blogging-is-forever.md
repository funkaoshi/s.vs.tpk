The [Bloggies][1] have me thinking about blogging. As you well know, I am pro-blogging. I think everyone should write and share their thoughts. My [personal blog][3] has been chugging along for over 20 years! [Social media is transient: blogs are forever.][2] There is value in writing stuff down.

It is easy to feel like a topic has already been discussed, that it’s common knowledge. But common to who? My ideas about gaming are informed by the books and blogs I have read, the games I’ve played, and the friends I have made along the way. I talked to people on Google+ a long time ago and left with a sense of what I want from RPGs. There are lots of new blogs that are clearly great, but that I don’t find that interesting because they feel like they talk about topics I’m done with. But so what! Not everything needs to be for everyone. There is always someone new who will come along and not know what’s up. Maybe they find some obscure Goblin Punch post from a decade ago. More likely they read stuff being shared right now.

Clayton won the Bloggies with his post on puzzle monsters. He dubbed this idea the [1HP monster][1hp], riffing off [an older forum post from stras][16hp]. This is one of my favourite parts about an active blog scene. People taking ideas and running with them, learning from one and other. Clayton’s post also introduces stras’s decade old post to a new generation of gamers.

[Reading the Elusive Shift left me with a strong sense that we are re-learning all the lessons of the 70s when it comes to RPGs.][4] People have done this all before, and will do it all again. That’s part of the fun of this hobby. Maybe you’ll discover that playing to find out what happens is what it’s all about, and share that with your friends. I’m sure the Bakers would be happy for you.

This blog is full of all sorts of posts of varying quality, and of varying interest to other people. I have a blog post about converting all the to-hit and AC scores in OD&D from descending to ascending AC, not because I thought it was revelatory, but because I didn’t want to have to work it out again. Sharing is caring, but the post was for me. There are lots of reasons to put stuff online. Perhaps the best is writing for yourself.
