I love [this post from Yochai about running a sandbox style][1] game using his game Cairn and the advice and tools from its Dungeon Masters guide. I'm a big fan of people writing about how they actually prep and run games. I wrote briefly about [the start of my Carcosa campaign][2], how I kicked it off, but never came back to talk about how it was going, or offer advice on running a hexcrawl. It's something I keep meaning to do, and seeing this post makes me want to do so all the more.
