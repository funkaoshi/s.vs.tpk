[Gus][], Mr. Dungeon Crawling himself, asks the hard questions: [why do most adventures suck?][1] He suggests ways to improve the adventures you are writing (to sell for cash-money). Something he touches on, that gets glossed over in a lot of the discussions I see about writing and running adventures, is around that distinction between writing to be consumed by yourself versus writing to be consumed by others. You can run an amazing session with keys that look like [the original keys for Dwimmermount][2]. You don’t need fancy maps. You don’t need perfect prose. You need enough information to remind yourself of the amazing ideas in your head!
