[The Fantastic is Fact has a great post about getting started playing OD&D][1], my favourite version of Dungeons and Dragons!   This post has a good overview of all the various retroclones of the game, including my favourite, [Delving Deeper][dd], and Marciaâ€™s Fantastic Medieval Campaigns. Also good links for further reading and resources, like [Philotomy's Musings][pm], which I also host here.
