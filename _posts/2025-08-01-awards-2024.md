My friend Warren messaged me a few days ago. “Ram,” he said, “reminder to write the Rammies, Ennies are in 2 days.”

Wait, what? The year zooms by and I'm always caught on the back foot. Even with the warning I didn’t really have time to get any of my thoughts down until … well right now. This post wasn’t written before the Ennies began, it will show up some time in the middle of their show. Oh well. I don’t really care about what the Ennies have to say one way or the other, and you shouldn’t either, but I won’t fault someone for loving the Teen Choice Awards of the RPG industry. Someone had to fill that void, why not ENworld? So much voting!

At the Ramanan Sivaranjan Awards for Excellence in gaming there is only one voter: me! There is only one rule when it comes to these awards: the books in contention must have arrived at my doorstep, or digitally in my inbox, during 2024. I had to think a little bit hard about these rules this year, as my copies of Swyvers and Gardens of Ynn arrived safe and sound at my *brother’s* door in the UK. I’ll see those books in a couple weeks, and so they will be in the running next year. Till then …

## Best Game: [*Break!!*][break2025] by Reynaldo Madriñan and Carlo Tartaglia

I waited, along with many friends, many years for this book. And then it finally arrived. I wasn’t always sure it would. But Rey and Carlo took their time and made something special. In the time between me first seeing Rey and GreyWiz working on *Break!!* to its eventual release it became a big chonky game. It’s not really the sort of game I play anymore. Character creation is 200 pages of this book! Come on, man. Of course, that also doubles as a lot of world building. *Break!!* has such an imaginative setting, a natural extension of Reynaldo’s Baroviania game. Reading the book it draws you it. Drew me in. I am prepping an inevitable game. *Break!!* feels well suited to eat 5Es lunch. The character creation is so detailed, there are lots of options and abilities and all that. Lots of ways to customize characters and gear to your liking. The vibes for the game are so perfect. Kitchen sink fantasy that feels very much its own. Carlo’s art is incredible. I would watch the *Break!!* Saturday morning cartoon. Perhaps one day we will get one.

## Best Setting: [*Gackling Moon*][gm2025] by Patrick Stuart & Tom K. Kemp

![The map of the Moonlands](/assets/img/gackling-moon-awards-2025.png)

Some motherfucking OSR nonsense from the man himself Patrick Stuart. *Gackling Moon* began its life on Patrick’s blog. For those not familiar, the book describes the Moonlands, a bizarre place for adventure. The book features art by Tom Kemp and feels like you are reading an in world artifact you would pick up at a museum exhibit about the region. This feels like Patrick’s take on the 2e Gazetteer as literary fiction. In many ways this is probably stretching the limits of what counts as a gaming book. There is so much creativity jammed into *Gackling Moon*, but actually turning that into an adventure to play is left as an exercise for the reader. Maps, stats, everything is absent. That the book features random tables is really the only explicit nod to gaming. But I disagree with those who would argue this isn’t a gaming book: everything was clearly written with an eye to how it would play on a table. This approach feels like less of a stretch—a gazetteer for a fantasy world—than the stat-less monster manual that was [*Fire on the Velvet Horizon*][fotvh]. (That book is amazing, by the way.) There is clear precedent for this style of fiction. Tom Kemp’s art is such a perfect match for the book, and contributes to the feeling this is the companion book to some gallery or museum exhibit. *Gackling Moon* is maximally creative. Often quite funny. More people should check it out.

## The Ramanan Sivaranjan Excellence in Gaming Best God Damn Books of 2024: [The Mothership Boxed Set][ms2025] by Sean McCoy & Friends.

A weird pick: [Mothership has already won this coveted spot][awards2018], but this boxed set is actually really fucking good. The game has matured in that time, lots of tweaks here and there. I’m less interested in those changes and more interested in what I would consider the centrepiece of this boxed set, it’s [Warden’s Manual][warden]. I love this book! Mothership’s Warden’s Manual is exactly what I want from a “DMG”: practical concrete advice on getting the game you bought to the table. How do you prep? What do you do in your first session? Etc. It’s all the juice. This boxed set made me want to run the game again. [And I did!][1e] The box conveniently includes an adventure, [Another Bug Hunt][abh], which I enjoyed running for my friends. Mothership has grown into a real behemoth since I first wrote about it. This game is probably someone’s first RPG, the Kickstarter raised so much money and had so many backers. What a lucky person.

## Honourable Mentions

I say this every year, but this year was a particularly competitive one. We had another beautiful boxed set with [Wulfwald][wulf2025] by Lee Reynoldson, [Owe My Soul to the Company Store][omscs2025] by Luther Gutekunst & R. Devlin, [Knave 2e][k2e] by Ben Milton & Peter Mullen, the nazi killing romp that is [EAT THE RIECH][er2025] by Grant Howitt & Will Kirkby and my new favourite rank & flank war-game, [Hobgoblin][hob2025] by Mike Hutchinson. I am a big fan of the first entrants to Troika 1:5 series, [Whalgravaak's Warehouse][ww2025] by Andrew Walter and [The Hand of God][hog2025] by Mike Knee and Andrew Walter. I’m really looking forward to the adventures to follow.
