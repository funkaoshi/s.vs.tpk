For [Mothership Month][1]—a crowdfunding campaign extravaganza—[Sean][2] decided to spend some of his marketing budget funding a crazy giant digital LARP. [Sam Sorensen][3] is running [Over/Under][4], a 100% bananas play-by-post “war-game”. There are over 1000 players! A much smaller subset are ‘bosses’ who get to make actual decisions and interact with Sam to direct the energies of the various factions in play. I had originally planned to avoid the game, it seemed so overwhelming (and honestly still is), but how often does stuff like this happen? I joined the Tempest Mercenary squad, because [Amanda][5] is the person in charge, and have been a loyal soldier ever since. The bulk of my “playing” consist of showing up when I see we’ve all been tagged and posting a salute emojis. I don’t think you really need to spend more effort than that if [you want to play as well][6]. If I had more time, I probably would have tried to ply my trade as a *misinformation* broker. Another time. I still don’t really understand what’s happening half the time. It’s still fun & weird experience nevertheless.
