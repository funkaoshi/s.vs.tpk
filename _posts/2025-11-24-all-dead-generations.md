When I first started this blog I had a periodic [series][bf] of posts where I would highlight blogs I thought were cool. At some point I likely switched to just linking to cool blogs on G+ (and eventually Twitter and BlueSky). [Dungeons of Signs][dos], by Gus, was [one of the blogs I thought people should know about][hl] many years ago. That blog is a classic. Gus stopped updating that Dungeons of Signs a few years ago, after becoming disillusioned with both the world and the OSR. But you can’t stop a man from talking about dungeons, so he returned with a new blog, [All Dead Generations][adg]. This blog is mostly **long** essays about how to design good dungeons. There is lots of great advice here. Most recently, he shared [a post on alternative obstacles to monsters in dungeons][lcmo]. It’s a good sample of the sort of stuff he’s been thinking about over the last few years. There is much more to read if you enjoy this post. He goes hard.
