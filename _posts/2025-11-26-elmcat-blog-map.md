[Elmcat has shared the map of the OSR blogosphere he has been working on for the last few weeks.][1] This project is incredible. He looked at all the links into and out of blogs to try and group them into communities, and understand what the prominent blogs in the scene are. [Grognardia][2] is [the sun][3], of course. Kind of incredible James left the scene for a decade and still has such an unrivalled output that it’s hard for anyone else to catch up.
