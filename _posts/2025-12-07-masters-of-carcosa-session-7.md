![Map of the caverns](/assets/img/masters-of-carcosa-caverns-to-castle.jpg)

The caverns the party explore this session were another way I had imagined to get the party out of the region they were in. The Protector of Truths was leading a group of Yellow Men in a war against evil Mi-Go on the other side of Carcosa. The Mi-Go the players would encounter on this part of the world were those lobotomized by The Protector of Truths, so they were more like animals than intelligent adversaries. My notes for the NPC were: disfigured, easy going, idealistic. I made a small map of the caverns that lead to the hidden castle, and then a map of the castle itself. I didn’t figure anything else about this particular thread, or who the evil Mi-Go on the other side of Carcosa were. This was the right call, because this was another thread the players didn’t end up pursuing.

This session was also the first encounter with the race of Space Aliens that made the mistake of exploring Carcosa long ago, who now find themselves trapped on the planet. The players would encounter more Space Aliens as the campaign progressed: the scientists that ran the abandoned output that started the campaign, and the bad-asses of the Space Alien Strikeforce.

This was a funny session, with the party wandering back and forth between the nearby towns and these caverns, where they kept encountering Mi-Go and not making much progress through the caverns.

**Recap:**

- The party decides to return once more to the hidden caverns to try and make their way into the citadel it is connected to, or perhaps catch some MiGo.
- They make their way to the cavern without incident. 
- They begin exploring. The Mi-Go are missing when they arrive.
- They snake North, and come to a room the suspect is full of Mi-Go.
- Backtracking they stumble on some shocked space aliens. 
- They are trapped in this cavern, clearly out of their element, running to avoid mi-go.
- The party agrees to help the spacemen escape: a simple task, the space men are right near the exit.
- The party walk back into the room they just came from: which is now full of Mi-Go feasting on a dead Ulfire Man..
- A fight! No one is injured, except the Mi-Go. One is captured alive, even.
- The aliens call for their buddies to come pick them up. Give the party ‘dog tags’ as a thanks.
- They teach the party how to say “greetings” in their alien body language.
- The party returns to town, Mi-Go in tow, for sale.
- The sage buys the Mi-Go, and two additional Mi-Go bodies from the party for 700 GP total.
- Rest and then back to the citadel and cavern.
- The party walk back into the first proper room of the complex, and of course stumble on Mi-Go. These ones are cleaning up the mess from last time.
- A battle! 
- Nick’s character is knocked out. He’s brought back to life via the strange red goop Dion’s character possessed. 
- Richard’s character is slain, but the rest of the party is victorious.
- On the trip back to town the party stumble upon some Ulfire Men, who fled an attack by the slavers. The rest of their party was captured.
- They return to Jahar with the party.

Treasure:
- 2 laser pistols
- 700 GP from sage
- 200 GP for additional Mi-Go bodies
- 200 GP for mysterious crystal thing—if you are willing to sell it to him.
