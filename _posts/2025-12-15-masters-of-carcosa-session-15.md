The players had their home base in Invak, and had a strong relationship with the merchant town to the south, Jahar. At this point in the campaign they wanted to try and unify the region around the common aim of dealing with the slavers. There was a lot of travel between the two towns session, as they tried to negotiate an agreement. This was the session the Space Alien Strike Force finally made an appearance. They had been hinted at over the previous session, and were an entry on my random encounter table for some time. They were looking for whomever desecrated their tomb and stole the armour of their hero. Bad luck for the players: Gus’s character was wondering around in that armour. Had been since they found it. Hilarity ensues. 

The players also reconnected with the women who escorted them to Invak at the start of the campaign, Queen of Autumn. Another random encounter roll? I don’t remember anymore.

**Players:**

- [Beloch Shrike][nick]: Renoir, Red Man Fighter
- Chris P: Bone Crone, Bone Women Sorcerer
- Dion: Asha-Rea, Ulfire Women Fighter
- Eric Boyd: Orange Julia, Orange Women Fighter
- [Evan][]: The Spangled Inquiry, Bone Man Sorcerer
- [Gus][]: Normangina, Yellow Women Fighter

**Recap:**

- The party heads South from Invak towards Jahar to learn more about the Staff of Avion and try and set up an alliance.
- The Speaker of all Graces seems disinterested in this idea, but doesn’t say no outright.
- Along the way they stumble upon the the Space Alien Strike Force: they are caught in a moment of rest.
- Gus hides behind a rock because he is wearing the amour they are looking for.
- The aliens have him sighted, so he ends up using his Solid Snake skills to sneak away. Meanwhile the rest of his team are friendly, and show the aliens they don’t have the armour. (And in fact saved their friends.)
- When they investigate where Gus was, they see no one was there.
- The party continues South, while Normangina takes a wide route to avoid the Aliens.
- Along the way she stumbles upon a dead body off in the distance, which she decides to avoid as well.
- Travelling further still she see a large Insectoid Spawn.
- She manages to distract it with her smell squid, and sprints further away.
- Finally she makes it back to the party.
- They travel back to the dead body, to see if it has any loot.
- They quickly learn there are several dead bodies, arranged in a circle head to toe with their arms reaching out to the centre. (So it looks like a spoke of a wheel.)
- They take one of the bodies, a Red Man.
- Evan’s character is loitering near by, he joins the group—strange. No one mentions it.
- In Jahar the party run errands.
- They convince the guard guild to recharge their weapons.
- Gus' Bazooka and Evan's teleportation Ray are fully charged.
- Drink with guards ends with crazy mayhem. The guards are even more friendly with the party now.
- Chris P' character steals small change from all the revellers, earning 60 GP
- The next day the guards get the party an audience with their leader.
- “The One” gives the players a letter saying he will support a military alliance with Invak
- the party travels North, actively searching for trouble, but end up finding the Blue Menhirs
- They arrive in Invak and give the Speaker of All Graces the letter of support.
- Travel East looking for Slavers.
- Find Queen of Autumn and the group that had went searching for her led by The Illustrious Prince of the Bone
- They had actually just rescued her from a Spawn, which they fled.
- The party is looking for trouble, however, so they head back in search of the Spawn they were fighting
- Kill that thing so hard. I need laser proof spawn.

**Other notes:**

- Gus puts out a bounty for raptors! And Eric will match that! And a hiring bounty as well!
- Eric looking for binoculars, Geiger counter, which will be set aside in Jahar if the merchants find one.
- Staff of Avion is left with the Sage. Owed 200GP if he learns anything about it.

**Treasure:**

- 1000 GP in Spawn Bounty (200 GP for them, 800 GP split between the party) so that's 133 XP each

**Comments:**

- **Ramanan S** (2015-10-13 04:49): The Queen of Autumn tells viewers to admit their mistakes rather than lying to cover them up.

    Wait, you guys didn't learn that lesson.
- **Gus L** (2015-10-13 04:51): Maybe - more lies and a few dead bodies will bury a mistake pretty deep?
