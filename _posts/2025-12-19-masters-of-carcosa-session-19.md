The players decide to head East, further into the territory friendly with the Jale Slavers. The town the players learn about, Joi, may have been lifted straight from an episode of Masters of the Universe. As sessions go this was pretty straight forward. Lots of chatter in town, and then an encounter in the wilderness. It feels weirdly short reading the re-cap below.

At this point I was so far behind on writing my Carcosa recaps that I stopped! I should try and do it retroactively from my notes now.

**Players:**

- [Gus][]: Normangina, Yellow Woman Fighter
- Stephen M  - Chongo
- Dion: Asha-Rea, Ulfire Women Fighter
- Eric Boyd: Orange Julia, Orange Women Fighter
- Chris P.: Bone Crone - Bone Women Sorcerer

**Recap:**

- In town the Bone Crone examines the dead Bone Men bodies, brought back from the snake men ruins.
- The party debates for some time on what their next course of action should be, before deciding to leave the snake me ruins alone to explore the slaver friendly towns to the East.
- The journey is uneventful: the party makes it to Joi unmolested
- They decide to set up a fake camp to lure people out of the town, who they hope to capture.
- Sure enough, a group of 10 Orange Men and Women make their way towards the campsite.
- The party wait for them to get close, than attack.
- Their apparent leader is knocked out in the course of battle, their second in command vaporized. Both leaders are women.
- The remaining men are captured, and marched back to Invak.

**Notes:**

- The captured orange men reveal the following: in Joi men are forced to work as slaves in underground mines while the women live in luxury in the beautiful city above.

**Comments**

- **Ramanan S** (2015-12-29 03:04): Let me know if I am missing stuff please: I waited too long to write this up.
- **Eric Boyd** (2015-12-29 03:16): What did the Bone Crone determine again?
- **Ramanan S** (2015-12-29 03:20): Ah yes, the dead bodies have decomposed to a point beyond what one would expect. They look and smell like they have been dead for weeks, despite being newly dead when they were brought to town. (When you guys were fighting them they appeared some what gaunt, but otherwise seemingly normal looking.)
- **Chris P.** (2015-12-29 03:22): You forgot me. I sad now.
- **Ramanan S** (2015-12-29 03:23): Ah yes: you beat me to my own game. 
- **Chris P.** (2015-12-29 03:23): Also, Ramanan S they had the sensation of some kind of bad magic (or the equivalent of some other unknown force) that I had no familiarity with at all.
- **Ramanan S** (2015-12-29 03:24): Yes that's right: the Bone Crone feels the mark of sorcery over all of this, but is aware of no such ritual.
- **Chris P.** (2015-12-29 03:36): We also found no biological markers inside of the bones or anything, at least not that we could identify. If there was any sort of wound reflecting what turned them into the monsters, it was lost among the many wounds we inflicted upon killing them.
- **Chris P.** (2015-12-29 03:37): Also no more radioactive than anything else.
- **Eric Boyd** (2015-12-29 03:40): Earworms or similar parasites would be really obvious with Bone Men, one presumes.
- **Chris P.** (2015-12-29 03:45): Hmmm, BY JOVE,  Eric Boyd  you may have it! MUSIC! Ramanan S  were they ever humming or moving unusually, like they were rocking back and forth or something?
- **Beloch Shrike** (2015-12-29 03:53): There was a session tonight? I never got an invite.
- **Ramanan S** (2015-12-29 03:53): No this was from last week. I just never wrote up the recap. I'm in holiday mode.
- **Eric Boyd** (2015-12-29 03:56): Chris P. I was thinking literally, not metaphorically: http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Ceti_eel But you might have something there...
- **Chris P.** (2015-12-29 04:29): Eric Boyd  yup, I knew, I just will use any excuse I can get for a pun. (Bonus points if it produces a good lead.)
- **Ramanan S** (2015-12-29 06:47): Music would be cute, but no they were basically totally stationary when encountered.
