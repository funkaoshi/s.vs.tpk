![Pits](/assets/img/putrescent-pits-maps.jpg)

More slaver killing antics, as the party heads north to investigate rumours of slaver activity. The party had liberated the Orange Man citadel North of their home base of Invak many sessions ago, but hadn’t returned in some time. This was another fairly vanilla session, but was a good setup for the next one, as they had plans for the body of one of the dead slavers.

Though the party was still completely uninterested in exploring [the Putrescent Pits of the Ameboid God][s3], I wanted to make it clear that there was another faction exploring the space in their stead. A note they find amongst the dead indicates someone out there was in search of as many slaves as they could get a hold of to explore “the pits”. 

My notes for the first floor of the dungeon describe two factions. Lawful Yellow Man cultists who are trying to prevent access to the pits, and Chaotic Purple Man cultists that worship the Ameboid God and want to venture down. There were two entrances down to a level I never bothered mapping (smart!), once guarded by the Lawful cultists, the other a secret entrance discovered by the Purple Men. These Purple Men cultists were operating in the wilderness, though North of the players, so they never really encountered them.

My notes of the dungeon from that time. Maybe I’ll revisit this one day:

> There are two levels of caverns above the actual Putrescent Pits of the Amoeboid God. These natural caverns were built by the Snakemen thousands of years ago to cover the actual pit that leads to the Amoeboid God.
> 
> - Who is here? Ameboid God Cultists. (Two factions: one inside the pit proper, the other trying to find their way down.) Mushroom Men. Space Aliens. Irrational Space Aliens. Primordial Ones. Shohgoths 
> - The pit travels from level 3 all the was to the lowest levels of the dungeon, terminating at the giant Ameboid God. Several entrances to other levels via the pit. 
> - God is several (hundred?) feet below the lowest level
> - Rival cults distributed between levels 3,4,5
> - Shogoths on lower levels
> - Aliens on 5,6,7 fighting irrational aliens
> - Fungus Men distributed throughout?
> - Primordial ones 8, 9 battle shogotths

Yeah, that could have been a fun time too.

**Players:**

- Eric Boyd: Orange Julia - Orange Women Fighter
- Chris P.: Bone Crone - Bone Women Sorcerer
- Dion: Asha-Rea, Ulfire Women Fighter

**Recap:**

- The party leaves Invak and heads north to Investigate rumours about more slaver activity.
- They are accompanied by 20 Bone Men from Invak, who will reinforce the citadel to the North.
- At the ford where the party normally crosses the river they spot two fish like dinosaurs.
- After some investigation it looks like they have just fed, and ignore the party
- The citadel welcomes the party. They inform them of two settlements near by that are friendly to slavers: a citadel of Blue Men to the North, and a Village of Green Men to the North East (South of the Putrescent Pits of the Ameboid God)
- The party decides to head to the Green Men village, along with two soldiers from the citadel.
- Along the way they come upon 13 Bone Men, and 14 slaves manacled together.
- The party skirts around and rolls down some rocks onto the slavers below, killing one person and somewhat blocking the path forward.
- A big fight breaks out!
- The Bone Crone is wounded, but manages to survive a blast from a  laser gun.
- The party manages to fall back and pick off the slavers in smaller groups, finally killing them all.
- The party leads the captured slaves back to the citadel, where they sleep for the night.
- They head to Invak in the morning.
- They dig up the old space alien armour, which they plan to put on a dead slaver and present to the space aliens.

Treasure:

- 13 dead slavers can be claimed for the slaver bounty (1300 GP)
- 14 slaves freed (1400 GP)
- 2 Laser Rifles ("long" range, d10 ammo die, 2dCarcosa damage)
- 13 Obsidian Swords
- 13 Black / Brown “Leather” armour
- 14 manacles with chain and two sets of keys
- 200’ of strong rope
- 20 bone spikes
- A letter requests "as many slaves as are currently available". A price of 50GP per slave is mentioned, some sort of bulk rate. "Must be reasonably able bodied, as they are to be sent down to explore the [putrescent] pits [of the ameboid god]."

**Comments:**

- **Eric Boyd** (2016-03-01 17:37): And two laser guns, d10 shot die, if I recall correctly. 
- **Ramanan S** (2016-03-01 17:38): Ah yes you are right!
- **Bryan Mullins** (2016-03-01 19:44): Nice one you all!
- **Chris P.** (2016-03-02 04:05): Gus L The tidbit about us finding a Jale slaver corpse and preparing to deliver it next session with the armor is probably relevant to you.
- **Chris P.** (2016-03-02 04:09): Also of note, that letter requesting the slaves, and buying at bulk rate, some jerk is REALLY interested in exploring the pits of the amoeboid god. We should look into this. Whomever is getting the Costco discount from the Jale slavers is not somebody I think we want breathing.
- **Gus L** (2016-03-02 06:46): Chris P. Indeed it is - with a day more notice  I will certainly be there - I don't mind giving up the armor for friendship and protection from the alien death squad.
