This is a blog about [D&D][dnd]. I didn't want to drown [my other blog][funkaoshi] in posts about THAC0 and Megadungeons, and so here we are.

I started playing D&D when I was 12 or 13. A family friend ran a campaign for myself, my brother, and my cousin using his copy of the [Rules Cyclopedia][6]. We played a Cleric, a Fighter, and a Rogue, respectively. I can't recall how long our campaign ran for. I can't really recall much of anything we did. I do remember fighting a dragon. It was great.

That was a million years ago. [I recently got back into D&D.][2] Wizards of the Coast announced D&D 4th Edition, which got one of my friends interested in running a game. This got me back into D&D. Some time later I stumbled upon [How to Host a Dungeon on MetaFilter][3]. I think from there I discovered the [Random Dungeon Generator Kickstarter project][4]. That led me to [Grognardia][5]. Once you discover Grognardia you learn that there is a whole world of D&D you weren't aware of.

This blog is another drop in the old-school D&D bucket.
