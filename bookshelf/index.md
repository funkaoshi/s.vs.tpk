I have lots of D&D books. I suspect I suffer from a problem common in the hobby: I like reading about D&D as much as I like playing D&D. All of my 2nd Edition books were purchased when I was in Jr. High and High School. The rest of the books were purchased in the last couple years, after I got back into D&D. Most of my books have my name written in them.

I'd like to get some of the rule books and modules that were out before I started playing. The problem is that I'm not sure if interest in the old material is greater than my dislike of poor typesetting and beat up books: time will tell!
