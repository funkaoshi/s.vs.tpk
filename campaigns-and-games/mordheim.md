## Undead vs. Mercenaries [Jan 31st 2023]

It was unclear to Khaimpo the Wretched why his master wanted the Wrydstone, but it was not his place to question commands. He was joined by the survivors of a group of mercenaries. (If this lot survived, he couldn't imagine how useless the rest of their former compatriots might be.) Volchyakrov's Wolves, as the dregs had taken to calling themselves, advanced through the city in search of the treasure, alongside the revenants raised by Khaimpo. Lord Volchyakrov had spied some Wrydstone. Securing it would be no easy feat: they found themselves beset by a group of mercenaries from Middenheim.

Khaimpo and his group skulked along an alleyway towards a stone, watching as Middenheimers approached from the opposite direction. One of his Dire Rats raced ahead, securing the stone in one of their grubby mouths, only to lose it to the blade of a Halberdier. With that the groups were on top of each other, the fighting fierce. In the end this stone was lost to the Middenheimers, though Vrouwer Koning didn't make things easy, laying a Halberdier low with a stiff blow from her staff.

The coward Peters Van der Peters surveyed the scene from a rooftop far from the action. He took potshots at mercenaries approaching a wyrdstone in a courtyard, for show more than anything else: he was a terrible shot. Lord Volchyakrov raced ahead, trailed by the recently dead of Mordheim. The two groups traded blows. He watched Volchyakrov fall. Was this to be his shortest mercenary stint yet? All the same, he remained unmotivated to move up and help his knew master. When Volchyakrov recovered, and laid the rival captain low, Van der Peters knew he had made the right call. His true job was to live another day, after all.

The Wolves retreated, a wyrdstone clutched in the hand of Lord Volchyakrov.
