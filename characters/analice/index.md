### Notes

* LotFP NPC Rolls: Beautiful, Sarcastic, Pacificst, Sexually Deviant.
* **Session 1** ([Zak's][zak] Game in the Red Queen's Castle)
  * Renamed Analice from [Alice][] for Zak's playtest and made her level 9 once more.
  * And I lost two levels from some god damn vampires minutes into the game-- deja vu.
  * Fell down a corridor / pit.
* **Session 2** ([Zak's][zak] Game in the Red Queen's Castle)
  * Once again I was grabbed by some vampires, but this time they didn't drink my blood.
  * Piratanegro has fallen to his death. 4 more players to go.
  * And I join Piratanegro, falling to my death.
