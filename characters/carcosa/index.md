### Equipment
 
 * Iron Battle Axe (1d8)
 * Iron Horned Helmet
 * He-Man Action Figure Style Breast Plate
 * Dowsing Rod
 * Books filled with strange runes and symbols.
 * **Alien Tank** (for Carcosan village)
 
### Notes
 
 * 3d6 in order.
 * Badass Metal Viking.
 * You do not know how to swim--just like in real life!
 * He encounters a party of strange foreigners, clearly from another planet. He aids them in finding their friend, a fellow named Chauncy. In the process he looses a friend, but gains an Alien tank.
 * He returns to his village, riding an Alien tank, accompanied by some fellow from a place called Wampus County.
 * Adventuring in the high seas of Zak's campaign, The Speaker of All Graces ends up fleeing pirates, ending up on an island peopled by goblins. The party pays them to protect them for 6 hours, which they do. There is a pitch battle with the pirates and another war band of goblins. It's a near TPK, but The Speaker of All Graces manages to save the day with the help of a couple goblins, Grintruck and Pustie. Sadly, Pustie didn't make it. The fight continues, but I need to sleep. Also, Joey showed up and healed me with his crazy chaos knight cleric.
 * Has an irrational hatred of dwarves (result 529 from the Metamorphica).
