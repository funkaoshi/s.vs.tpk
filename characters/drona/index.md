### Notes
 
 * [Brendan's page about Pahvelorn][pahvelorn]
 * Previous sessions recorded on [Satyavati's character sheet][satyavati]
 * Drona is deeply sadened to learn his fool hardy master was killed in the pursuit of tresure.
 * Now it is his turn to venture into the depths of Pahvelorn and avenge man he raised from childhood!
 * What will we learn of Drona's dark and mysterious past? Where did he learn to fight? How did he end up a simple servant? 
 * Drona is 59 years old.
