### Notes

* A Saint for Bryan's Blackmash LotFP game.
* [**Session 1**][1] 
  * We start *in media res*, investigating what looks to be a torture chamber. 4 monsters covered head to toe in armour start approaching.
  * It is a rough fight. An evil cleric joins the fray, and commands Lady Duggan to flee. He has a sorcerer mark on his arm, of vines and grapes.
  * A secret door leads into a room guarded by 4 elf-like creatures, which are quickly dispatched. (They interrogate on of the elves, before killing him as well.)
  * The characters find a brass idol, and a lever that could be pulled.
  * Lady Duggan, being the hyper rational cynical cleric that she is, informs the party of how much the statue is worth, and they decide to defile this place.
  * We're rich!
  * 5100 SP / 5640XP, split 4 ways: **+25 GP**, **+25 SP**, **+1410 XP**
* [**Session 2**][2]
  * 5 SP for upkeep.
  * We cleanse one suit of armour.
  * Into the dungeon! We head down to the second level and make our way around. Once more we plundered, avoided getting sucked into a deeper discussion with some vampy elves, and did some more defiling of holy artifacts.
  * **+217 SP** and **+293 XP**
* [**Session 3**][3]
  * 5 SP upkeep.
  * Haven action spent cleansing a suit of armour. Failed!
  * We were attacked by a Wyveren, and Lady Duggan was knocked out. The party took a week to recuperate.
  * 5 SP for myself, and 5 SP for Shimrod for upkeep.
  * We cleanse one suit of armour.
  * We go and visit a captured talking chimp called Tiselo. Lady Duggan is so offended by this that she pays for the creature and sets him free. The party escorts the creature back to his home.
* [**Session 4**][4]
  * !!!
