I'm playing in a few online games at the moment. Having my character sheets online seems like the thing to do. I'm not a big fan of Google Docs, so here we are.

All the characters I have loved and lost, eventually. The active and the living:

 * \[4e, 2009--\] Duryodhana, Level 5 Warlock.
 * [\[OD&D, 2012\] Greggor][greggor], Level 4 Fighter who survived a [one-shot Dwimmermount][dwimmermount] game at [OSRCon][]. Now used for the occasional Google+ Dwimmermount play-tests.
 * [\[B/X D&D, 2012--\] Bluto Curfew][bluto], Level 1 Cleric in Gustie's [ASE][ase] game.
 * [\[B/X D&D, 2012--\] The Speaker of All Graces][carcosa], Level 1 Bone Man Fighter from Carcosa!
 * [\[OD&D, 2013--\] Karna][karna], Level 1 Cleric of [Pahvelorn][].
 * [\[Finchbox, 2013--\] Jubei Kamata][jubei], Level 2 Fighter Protagonist.
 * [\[B/X D&D, 2014--\] Turgeon Narof][turgeon], Level 1 Elf of Akenia.

 * \[4e, 2012\] Malagarr, Level 3 Cleric. Killed, and then killed again, while playing [D&D Encounters Season 10: Council of Spiders][d&d-season-10]. She wasn't meant for this world.

All the characters I played back in high school and grade school are lost to history. They will be missed.
