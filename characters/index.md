I'm playing in one online game at the moment, and i'm hoping to do a bit more of that. Having my character sheets online seems like the thing to do, and i'm not a big fan of Google Docs. So here we are.

All the charcaters I have loved and lost, eventually. The active and the living: 

 * \[4e, 2009--\] Duryodhana, Level 5 Warlock.
 * [\[DCC RPG, 2012--\] Theotorman the Ever Thankful][theotorman], Former Bee Keeper turned Lawful Level 2 Cleric
 * [\[OD&D, 2012\] Greggor][greggor], Level 4 Fighter who survived a [one-shot Dwimmermount][dwimmermount] game at [OSRCon][]. Now playin online via Google+.
 * [\[B/X, 2012--\] Maria][maria], the Neutral Level 1 Rune Knight of Baroviania.
 * \[4e, 2012\] Malagarr, Level 1 Cleric.
 * [\[OD&D, 2012\] Satyavati][satyavati], Level 1 Magic-User of [Pahvelorn][].
 
And the dead and the retired: 

 * \[4e, 2012\] Gretzyln, Level 1 Cleric. [Killed in a TPK.][total-party-kill]
 * \[4e, 2012\] Osrik, Level 1 Paladin. [Killed in another TPK.][dead-again]
 * \[4e, 2012\] Rowatek, Level 3 Warlock. Retired after completing [D&D Encounters Season 9: Web of the Spider Queen][d&d-season-9] campaign.

All the characters I played back in high school and grade school are lost to history. They will be missed.
