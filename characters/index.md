I'm playing in a few online games at the moment. Having my character sheets online seems like the thing to do. I'm not a big fan of Google Docs, so here we are.

All the characters I have loved and lost, eventually. The active and the living: 

 * \[4e, 2009--\] Duryodhana, Level 5 Warlock.
 * [\[DCC RPG, 2012--\] Theotorman the Ever Thankful][theotorman], Former Bee Keeper turned Lawful Level 2 Cleric
 * [\[OD&D, 2012\] Greggor][greggor], Level 4 Fighter who survived a [one-shot Dwimmermount][dwimmermount] game at [OSRCon][]. Now used for the occasional Google+ Dwimmermount play-tests.
 * [\[B/X D&D, 2012--\] Maria][maria], the Neutral Level 1 Rune Knight of Baroviania.
 * [\[B/X D&D, 2012--\] Bluto Curfew][bluto], Level 1 Cleric in Gustie's [ASE][ase] game.
 * [\[B/X D&D, 2012--\] The Speaker of All Graces][carcosa], Level 1 Bone Man Fighter from Carcosa!
 * [\[OD&D, 2012--\] Drona][drona], Level 1 Fighter of [Pahvelorn][].
 
And the dead and the retired: 

 * \[4e, 2012\] Gretzyln, Level 1 Cleric. [Killed in a TPK.][total-party-kill]
 * \[4e, 2012\] Osrik, Level 1 Paladin. [Killed in another TPK.][dead-again]
 * \[4e, 2012\] Rowatek, Level 3 Warlock. Retired after completing [D&D Encounters Season 9: Web of the Spider Queen][d&d-season-9] campaign.
 * \[4e, 2012\] Malagarr, Level 3 Cleric. Killed, and then killed again, while playing [D&D Encounters Season 10: Council of Spiders][d&d-season-10]. She wasn't meant for this world.
 * [\[LotFP, 2012\] Analice][analice], Level 9 Specialist. Fell to her death exploring the Red Queen's castle.
 * [\[OD&D, 2012\] Satyavati][satyavati], Level 1 Magic-User of [Pahvelorn][].

All the characters I played back in high school and grade school are lost to history. They will be missed.
