### Notes

* [Brendan's page about Pahvelorn][pahvelorn]
* Previous sessions recorded on the character sheets of [Satyavati][] and [Drona][].
* **Pahvelorn Session #22**: \[[G+][session-22]]
  * [Drona][] is dead!
  * Karna, a young cleric of Ilum Zugot, joins the Order of Gavin in their return to the barrows. The party returns to the room the party almost died within, to loot the remaining furs and skulls. They then venture into the natural caves and begin exploring. They discover a second exit to the barrow, and another way down to the 3rd level. Traveling on they encounter a possibly undead noble. The party returns to Ilum Zugot with their loot.
  * Gains: **+2103 GP**, hot damn.
  * Spending: TODO
