### Notes

* [Brendan's page about Pahvelorn][pahvelorn]
* Illustration of Karna by [Gustie from Dungeon of Signs][gustie].
* Previous sessions recorded on the character sheets of [Satyavati][] and [Drona][].
* **Pahvelorn Session #22**: \[[G+][session-22]] \[[Gustie][gustie-22-23]]
  * [Drona][] is dead!
  * Karna, a young cleric of Ilum Zugot, joins the Order of Gavin in their return to the barrows. The party returns to the room the party almost died within, to loot the remaining furs and skulls. They then venture into the natural caves and begin exploring. They discover a second exit to the barrow, and another way down to the 3rd level. Traveling on they encounter a possibly undead noble. The party returns to Ilum Zugot with their loot.
  * Gains: **+2103 GP**, hot damn.
  * Spending: 1500 GP on spell research (Fear), and 10 GP training Shalya ratling, 5 GP upkeep, 1 GP pay for Shalya. (**+3167 XP**)
  * Failed Save vs. Magic for Magical Research.
  * Research result: "Your research in the Priest-King's sutra library has revealed that to make more progress in your supplication, you must seek out the **tomb of Nisket-Kah**, an ancient warrior queen whose helm is said to be ornamented with writing that will unlock the power that you seek. Creatures of darkness were said to cower in awe of the power of light as manifested in her conquests. Your research has also uncovered a map leading to the north, on the edge of the great desert. Strangely, the map is inscribed with runes for 'beacon' in addition to 'way-finding'."
* **Pahvelorn Session #23**: \[[G+][session-23]] \[[Gustie][gustie-22-23]]
  * The party witnesses the execution of an evil sorcerer and his minions. They then head back to the lower barrows. Another delve filled with more violence than usual. The party stops the summoning of a demon, presumably, and returns to the town with much loot.
  * Gains: **1185 GP**
  * Spending: 1500 GP on spell research (Fear), 5 GP upkeep, 1 GP pay for Shalya. (**+3156 XP**)
  * Failed Save vs. Magic for Magical Research, again.
* **Pahvelorn Session #24**: \[[G+][session-24]]
  * Once more into the barrows, the party retraces their last steps through lower levels. Exploring the level below the 'punishment room', the party discovers a crypt full of bodies. There is a small alter dedicated to some snake god, where giant flies steal Beni's hat and Darulin's magic sword. After some misadventures everything is recovered, with extra loot to boot. While exploring natural caverns Shalya, Ratling Porter, is killed by a falling boulder. **Tragedy**.
  * Gains: **13,835 GP**: holy shit.
  * Spending: 9145 GP on spell research (fear), 5 GP upkeep, 1800 GP to train Ginny Bo (**+21,010** XP)
* **Pahvelorn Session #25**  \[[G+][session-25]]
  * The party takes a break from dungeoneering to clear a road! On the way they come across a group of giants attacking a farm house. There is some killing, but they manage to subdue the last of the giants Margosk. An agreement is made between the players and the giant. Each player carves a bell in their arm, to commemorate the occasion. After making sure the farmstead is safe and secure, the party continues their journey. Making camp in the ruins of a guard tower over looking a small river, the party encounters ...
  * Gains: **TODO**
  * Spending: **TODO**
