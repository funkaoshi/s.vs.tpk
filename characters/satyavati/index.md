<!--
Filigree (Arcane)
Level 3
Range: n/a
Duration: 1 day (until used)
A glowing circlet of air forms, and when placed upon someone’s head that person can make one jump up to a mile in height. He takes half damage coming down, so it is often imperative to land on something at the top of the jump. The caster cannot wear the filigree – it will consume him until he is nothing but motes of light that drift away upon the wind.

Tarnu’s Collaring Coiffure
Level 2
Range: 60ft
Duration: 2d4 rounds
The victim’s hair, if it is long enough, animates and begins to strangle him. There is no saving throw, and the victim will die within 2d4 rounds unless the hair is cut. Cutting the hair short ends the danger.

Krialian's centrifugal barrier
Level 4
As per protection from normal missiles, 10' radius, but opponents must save vs. wands to avoid their projectiles being flung back at them.

   * Zorfath is under attack! The party comes to the aid of the town and fights of advances of beast men. The party learns that the attack wasn't random: the beast men have stolen the baby that the snake cultists have been worshiping as their chosen one! (Mental note: don't ignore rumours.) The party ventures into Pahvelorn the next day, aided by two beast men: Larn and Brac. Using the Star Talisman they get past the lion trap that guards the entry way into the beast men's lair--who had previously burnt to a cinder the valiant Lune--and proceed to kill beast men in an epic quest for the missing baby. Their search was fruitless... this time!

On the trip back to Zorfath the party passes by a 100 person caravan of people dressed in the same armor as Tangle--they aren't to be messed with. Back in Zorfath: a boy has been kidnapped! Probably by a Beastmen, or a beastly man. So it is off into Pahvelorn: the adventurers kill a shit ton of skeletons and meet Al Menevar, Lord of the Dead. His master was clearly killed by the party several weeks ago. Satyavati parlays with the necromancer: they agree that both parties will leave the other alone--for now.

Entering the Zigurat, a staircase leads down to a submerged chamber. The party manages to cross the first room they find, despite a giant ooze that makes their life difficult. The second room contains an altar, which the party decides to muck around with--**twice**: Satyvati didn't survive the second time.

   * **DEAD!**
