<!--
Filigree (Arcane)
Level 3
Range: n/a
Duration: 1 day (until used)
A glowing circlet of air forms, and when placed upon someone’s head that person can make one jump up to a mile in height. He takes half damage coming down, so it is often imperative to land on something at the top of the jump. The caster cannot wear the filigree – it will consume him until he is nothing but motes of light that drift away upon the wind.

Tarnu’s Collaring Coiffure
Level 2
Range: 60ft
Duration: 2d4 rounds
The victim’s hair, if it is long enough, animates and begins to strangle him. There is no saving throw, and the victim will die within 2d4 rounds unless the hair is cut. Cutting the hair short ends the danger.

### Notes

 * 3D6 in order, random equipment, random grimoires (Arcana Metaphysica and On Essence), random background (bankrupt), random retainer (servant).
 * Previously lived to the west in the village surrounding the stronghold of Trolmun, ruled by the great necromancer Efulziton the Unseen.
 * His attempts at magical research have left him completely bankrupt. He has lost his home and wealth. As such he has left his home town in search of adventure. His loyal servant Drona came with him, having nothing and no one to return to.
 * The forces of Efulziton are currently engaged in a war against some sort of demonic incursion from the west, another reason to leave.
 * [**Pahvelorn Session #7**][session-7]: in which the adventures kill some cultists, find a map of the sewers, and discover a mansion full of demons.
 * 100GP spent on lavish living. (**+105 XP**)
 * **Pahvelorn Session #8**: in which the adventures rescue bandits and villagers, before finally being given a chance to once again explore a mansion full of demons. The party now has a demon butler named Tangle.
 * 100 GP spent on lavish living, 5GP for Drona, 50 GP on a centipede anti-toxin and 100 GP on a black widow. I'll pay Drona 5 GP because he's my loyal servant. 100 GP on a Read Magic scroll. (**+373 XP**)
 * **Pahvelorn Session #9**: in which the adventurers reach a détente with the Lizard Cultists, and then proceed to explore the crystal caverns underneath the mansion, earning much gold and glory.
 * 100 GP spent on lavish living, 500 GP on building a second level to the Gavin House, that will take 7 weeks to complete, 5 GP to pay Drona. (**+635 XP**)
 * **Pahvelorn Session #10**: Zorfath is under attack! The party comes to the aid of the town and fights of advances of beast men. The party learns that the attack wasn't random: the beast men have stolen the baby that the snake cultists have been worshiping as their chosen one! (Mental note: don't ignore rumours.) The party ventures into Pahvelorn the next day, aided by two beast men: Larn and Brac. Using the Star Talisman they get past the lion trap that guards the entry way into the beast men's lair--who had previously burnt to a cinder the valiant Lune--and proceed to kill beast men in an epic quest for the missing baby. Their search was fruitless... this time!
