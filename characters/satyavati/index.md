### Notes
 
 * 3D6 in order, random equipment, random grimoires (Arcana Metaphysica and On Essence), random background (bankcrupt), random retainer (servant).
 * Previously lived to the west in the village surrounding the stronghold of Trolmun, ruled by the great necromancer Efulziton the Unseen.
 * His attempts at magical research have left him completely bankcrupt. He has lost his home and wealth. As such he has left his home town in search of adventure. His loyal servant Drona came with him, having nothing and no one to return to.
 * The forces of Efulziton are currently engaged in a war against some sort of demonic incursion from the west, another reason to leave.
 * [Pahvelorn Session #7][session-7]: in which the adventures kill some cultists, find a map of the sewers, and discover a mansion full of demons.
 * 100gp spent on lavish living.
 * **TODO**: Pahvelorn Session #8: in which the adventures rescure bandits and villagers, before finally being given a chance to once again explore a mansion full of demons. They know have a demon buttler named Tangle.
 * 10gp spent on standard living.
