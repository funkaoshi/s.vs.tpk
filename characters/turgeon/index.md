### Notes

* [**Session 1:**][1] Turgeon Narof was deposited in this strange dungeon by a strange blue hand, and was promptly eaten by a purple worm. Thankful his acid resistant armour saved him, but not his friends. Some time later, A party of adventurers cause the beast to vomit him up. After defeating the beast, he ventures back down the monsters gullet looking for treasure—of course. A strange acid merman has been living in the worm. A fight breaks out, and Turgeon is knocked unconscious. His new friends manage to save his life after killing the creature. Continuing on they wander into a room full of ladies making strange clicking noises, who probe their minds with their psychic powers … (+1250 XP, 750 GP in loot)
* [**Session 2:**][2]:  Off to Rappan Athuk. We almost lose a player to a pit trap, but instead find a halfling who had fallen into the pit. He was happy to be saved. We kill 4 mysterious men who stumble out of a door leading to the South, which we proceed to explore. Some creepy monsters are fought, pit traps avoided, etc. (+???? XP, ??? GP in loot, 5GP for upkeep, 5GP for a retainer, 5 GP for Ferry to Dungeon)
