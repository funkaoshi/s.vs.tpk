### Notes

* [**Session 1:**][1] Turgeon Narof was deposited in this strange dungeon by a strange blue hand, and was promptly eaten by a purple worm. Thankful his acid resistant armour saved him, but not his friends. Some time later, A party of adventurers cause the beast to vomit him up. After defeating the beast, he ventures back down the monsters gullet looking for treasure—of course. A strange acid merman has been living in the worm. A fight breaks out, and Turgeon is knocked unconscious. His new friends manage to save his life after killing the creature. Continuing on they wander into a room full of ladies making strange clicking noises, who probe their minds with their psychic powers… (+1250 XP, 750 GP in loot)
