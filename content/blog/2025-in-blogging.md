The past year ended up being the biggest year of blogging on this site. At the start of the year I shared my thoughts on blogging in the post [Blogging is Forever][1], a reminder that social media is transient and you should own and control the writing you care about. I was posting fairly consistently throughout the year, but kicked things into high gear in November. This is almost certainly motivated by seeing [Elmcat’s blogging map][2]. It’s incredible seeing the web of people that contribute to this scene. The map is a nice reminder of what makes blogging fun and cool. I visited my brother in the UK at the end of November, and blogged more or less every day through to the New Year.

I had wanted to get my [Carcosa session recaps][3] back online for some time, and decided to do that for the month of December, using it as an opportunity to talk about running the campaign at the same time. After posting them all I finally wrote a post I had intended to write back when the campaign concluded: [Advice for Running a Hexcrawl, A Decade Too Late][4].

[I also wrote 10 reviews in 2025.][5] I haven’t written this much about games since 2013. I ended up reviewing as many war games as RPGs and modules last year. Wargaming has ended up becoming where I spend a lot of my time and energy. Those games were: [Xenos Rampant][6], [Trench Crusade][7], [MAC Attack][8], [Space Gits][9], and [Blood Bowl][10]. For RPGs I wrote about: [Skorne][11], [Constant Downpour Remastered][12], [Nirvana on Fire][13], [Wandering Blades][14], and [Crown of Salt][14] to close out the year.

There was one post I wanted to write before the clock ticked over to 2026 that I didn’t manage to get in under the wire: a comparison of Carcosa with Mythic Bastionland. I feel like there is something to say about both those games, I just need to think a bit more about what exactly. 

Hopefully 2026 continues the trend of more blogging: for myself and for all the other people I see starting blogs and returning to their old ones. 2025 feels like it was a big year for blogging.
