I used to try and get my [awards][] published _before_ the [Ennies][] announced their winners. I was worried a book I liked winning an Ennie would take away from my also giving that book an award. But then I thought, "the Ennies are really stupid: they should be racing to beat me."

Just when I think the Ennies are getting their shit together they go and nominate Dirk for best cartography, but not for best art? And then both Troika (Best Game of 2018) and Silent Titans (short-listed for 2019) don't win anything? Come on! I do see more names I know getting the recognition they deserve, but the Teen Choice Awards of the RPG industry will never truly provide what I am looking for.

The Ramanan Sivaranjan Awards for Excellence in Gaming continue to be a beacon of shining light in the darkness that is the table-top role playing game scene. The judges have deliberated at length about the merits and artistic achievement of each book, agonizing discussions that run for months on end. No votes or pandering: voting gets you Trump and Brexit. 

The books in contention were all bought by myself in 2018, or fulfilled as Kickstarter rewards or pre-orders that year. Basically, if I didn't have it in 2018 then it's not on my long list for these awards. That's basically it. I know what you're saying: "Ram, 2018 was so fucking long ago." Look man, I don't make up the rules. (Actually, what you're probably wondering is why the 2019 awards are for books I grabbed in 2018. Now that's a good question.)

### Best Game: David Black for the [Black Hack 2e][bh]

![Awards 2019 The Black Hack](/assets/img/awards-2019-the-black-hack.png)

David Black's simple rules for playing D&D, the eponymous Black Hack, felt like a real part of the zeitgeist with its initial release. People have always been hacking up their games of D&D, but now all of a sudden those hacks became This Hack or That Hack. The second edition of the Black Hack takes everything that made the first edition so great and refines it neatly. The game is still clear and concise, but with some refinements that makes the game stand out a bit on its own. The new book is a lovely hardback, with enough tables to keep you gaming for some time. [This is the good stuff.][bh-review]

### Best Setting Book: Jason Sholtis for [Operation Unfathomable][ou] (with layout by Jez Gordon)

![Awards 2019 Operation Unfathomable](/assets/img/awards-2019-operation-unfathomable.png)

I was, to put it lightly, maximum hyped for the release of Operation Unfathomable. Jason Sholtis would share all his illustrations on G+, presumably as he wrapped them up, and I would +1 those posts so hard. It felt like he was drawing for ages and ages. And then there was a Kickstarter and finally a book. True joy. In many ways this book exists in contrast to the Veins of the Earth (Best Setting of 2018). Both books present the horrors of the Underdark, but Operation Unfathomable has a sort of goofy cartoon charm that I love. There is time travel and laser guns and bug monsters: all the good stuff. That we have two glorious visions of the Mythical Underworld, each bizarre and unique in their execution, is a testament to the creativity within the OSR. Jason's adventure is a good introduction to what could be a longer jaunt in the underworld. (His players apparently said no thank you to the terrors of the deep, forcing him to develop the next overland adventure he plans to publish.)

### The Ramanan Sivaranjan Excellence in Gaming Best God Damn Books of 2018: [Mothership & Dead Planet][mothership] by Sean McCoy, Donn Stroud, and Fiona Maeve Geist

Technically, these are two different books. I don't give no fucks. I got both zines at the same time, I read them at the same time, and I fell in love with them at the same time. With Dead Planet and Mothership we are given a sufficiently creepy scenario to freak your players out with, and the rules you'd need to run a sufficiently creepy science-fiction horror game. They are both short zines: an excellent format for games. Both books really stand out because of their graphic design. Sean has said he took his inspiration from magazines rather than books, and I think the approach works well. Mother Ship and Dead Planet are so visually engaging as you flip through them. Dead Planet in particular is a very colourful affair, but that colour is used to great effect. Mothership reminds me of Alien, while Dead Planet reminds me a bit more of that crossed with Warhammer 40,000. What's not to love? 

### Honourable Mentions

Lots of love to [Trophy][] by Jesse Ross (found in the Gauntlet Codex Dark 2), [The Dolorous Stroke][tds] by Emmy Allen, [Knave][] by Men Milton, and [Through Ulthans Door][tud] by Ben Laurence. Trophy has been slowly growing with each issue of [the Gauntlet's Codex zines][codex], and I'm really curious to see what it becomes.

My love of Warhammer continues unabated, and I would be remiss if I didn't give [Kill Team][killteam] a shout out. So much of my last year has been spent playing games of Kill Team or building and painting miniatures in preparation for those games. Warhammer has helped keep me sane. Warcry is out right now, so 2019 RPG authors you are once again on notice.
