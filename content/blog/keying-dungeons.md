I have written about keying dungeons in the past, [when discussing Dwimmermount][1], and [when talking about Deep Carbon Observatory][2]. This topic seems to be in the news again, after [Ben shared an enjoyable video of his dislike of Goodman Games’ house style for their modules][3].[^1] [DCC RPG][4] is quite text heavy, and uses simple two column layouts reminiscent of old TSR modules. They are essentially the best version of an old TSR module. I love many of the DCC RPG adventures, but I don’t love all the walls of text. On the flip side, I am not a big fan of the Old School Essentials house style Ben advocates for either. I find the excessive bolded text and bullet points harder to parse than straight forwards sentences. I also think it’s much more enjoyable to read plain prose.

* **All the room keying hacks you see really aren’t necessary if your room keys are short and quick to read.** 
* You should start room descriptions with the things players will notice right away. Don’t bury the lede. 
* You should cut anything extraneous. You could take the time to list out all the torture devices found in the torture room, but I would only bother if there is some value in letting the GM and players know about the particulars. A GM can likely ad-lib there is a rack and iron maiden if those things are simply there to provide colour.[^2] 

To me, there is more value in trying to write something short and evocative, than try and turn it into a deconstructed sandwich.

[^2]: Of course, once ad-libbed into existence, they become part of the fictional world, something players can take advantage of in play.
