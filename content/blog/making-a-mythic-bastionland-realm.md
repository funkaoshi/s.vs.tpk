Long time readers may recall I had started an Arthurian Dark Souls sort of setting I never finished called [Misericorde][]. A year or so later [Chris][] started sharing his work for [Mythic Bastionland][mb], and it was more or less exactly what I wanted to do, but better in basically every way. (I mean, for starters, he finished it all.) So anyway, I want to play Mythic Bastionland. The first step is making a realm.

Chris outlines how to create a realm on a single page in the book. [Elm Cat has an incredibly thorough post about getting started with Mythic Bastionland that also discusses making a realm.][elm] They expand upon Chris’s advice with their own, based on their experience having run the game for a while. [Chris’s video of preparing a realm for play is also great.][mbyt] He walks you through his process. You can watch how he uses the spark tables to flesh out a setting. [^1]  Chris preps his realm in an about an hour. It took me longer—but not that much longer! These two resources are well worth reviewing.

I started by making a map in [Hex Kit][hk], a fun activity in and of itself. I decided to start a fresh map rather than continue off the one I had made a few years ago. In my head this campaign could be a prequel to the game I had thought of running, where the king is dead and knights wander the wilderness as transformed monstrosities. I can come back to that idea later, perhaps informed by how this Mythic Bastionland campaign unfolds.

With the map done, I got to populating the realm with some holdings and landmarks. I followed Chris’s advice and examples. The system works! I enjoy the act of building something out of random seeds, trying to figure out how everything could fit together. My first ruler was interested in gambling. So was my second. And so was my third. I thought of re-rolling, but the fact that three of the four leaders in the land are gamblers feels like the seed of a story. These sorts of connections bubble up as you work through the tables. I think our brains are just wired find a way to make everything make sense.

I need to actually play Mythic Bastionland, so will try and avoid being overly effusive, but even in this lonely fun of prepping the game it feels like Chris has made something really spectacular. I don’t consider myself particularly creative, but the book will make sure you can build something weird and interesting. Making a realm and figuring out what’s going on before the players show up was fun. Will it all work in play? I gotta assume so, since everyone else can’t shut up about how great the game is. Stay tuned!


[^1]: Another excellent resource is the [Mythic Bastionland Referee Companion][mbrc]. All the spark tables are available online, and it can roll on all the tables for you in one go, which can speed up the process of building a realm. I just used the book, but I can see how this could be useful. It’s cool seeing other people making digital tools for RPGs.
