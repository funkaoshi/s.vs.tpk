I remember this session really well, because it was another weird one. Only Dion and Willie could make it, and they didn’t want to do anything risky. The players travelled with the merchants on their trip South, stopping in the village of Glom. There they met affable Carcosans and got totally wasted. The description for the settlement in the hex is as follows: _Village of 310 Ulfire Men ruled by “the Unapproachable
Radiance,” a neutral 6th-level Sorcerer_. A lot of the Carcosa book is villages like this. That somehow transformed into what is described in the recap below. I am quite certain that going into this session I thought the players would return to the cavern they had been exploring, and so when they didn’t I had to spin something out from my most meagre of notes. Besides the description in the Carcosa book, the only thing I knew about this town was its name, which I had given it when drawing the initial region map for the campaign. In my notes I had something about Mer-Man cultists worshiping Cthulhu by the lake. I’m pretty sure I came up with the idea of evil Cthulhu lake water as a type of booze, and then just extrapolated everything else from that. Sometimes that’s what you gotta do.

This is the first session Eric missed! There was a mixup because I kept on rescheduling. This is why you need to be consistent when you’re running games!

[In my Carcosa-style recap for the session, I’m much more explicit about what’s going on in the town.][s10]

**Players:**

- Dion: Asha-Rea, Ulfire Women Fighter
- Willie Burke: Grenn, White Man Sorcerer

**Recap:** 

- The party begins the session in Jahar, where they returned with the body of a dead amoured space alien and a Bone Man cultist who attacked them on the road. They learned of the base the cultists presumably operate out of.
- Since there were only two players today the group decided to avoid the cultists enclave and head South with the traders.
- The party ended up in the city of Glom, the trip South was uneventful.
- The merchants stay in a quiet Inn, with no name but a strange ancient symbols etched on its door. Sorcerers will recognize this as the snake man word for Torture Gallery.
- The party wanders around town, which seems to be a surprisingly easy going place.
- They come upon a louder and more boisterous tavern.
- The bar servers two drinks, “lake water”, and a purple lotus concoction.
- Asha-Rea samples the lotus drink, Grenn the lake water.
- Each gets plastered in their own way.
- They wake up the next day back in the original inn. (TODO: make a carousing table!)
- The next day they explore the town.
- “the Joy-Giver of All the Living” sells tonics and potions made out of the lake water. They buy a “healing potion”
- “the Inestimable Fullness” is a tailor that is built like the Kingpin. They buy fancy hats from him, and Asha-Rea buys a set of clothes. They will be ready in a week.
- The party decides to trek to the near by lake to collect water for sale to the Alchemist.
- This occurs without incident, but the lake gives them a thoroughly creepy vibe. There are rumours it is full of Deep Ones.
- They see a monument of statues in the distance, surrounded by pillars. They don’t investigate!
- They return to town with two barrels of the bizarre lake water, which they sell for 50GP a pop.
