Some important discoveries this session. The Rainbow Connection finally discover the lair of the Jale Slavers. They had first learned of it after rescuing some slaves in the wilderness. They would begin to plot its downfall starting now.

They meet my Carcosa take on Trap-Jaw. I had written up a Carcosa style He-Man encounters, though I didn't end up using too many in my game: [16 Encounters on Carcosa][h1] & [16 More Encounters on Carcosa][h2]. Master's of the Universe was meant to be core to the whole game, and I tried to inject littles bits and pieces of that world when I could. I wrote these encounters after reading Richard's [How Brightly Coloured Should Carcosa Be][color]. This post about Carcosa and Masters of the Universe was one of the biggest inspirations for my game. It's what got me thinking about Carcosa in a completely different way.

They also discovered that the Castle of Decline was empty. The Bone Men from that town had said they would join them in Invak many sessions ago, but never made it. The party would learn what happened to them for a few more sessions. (Half travelled south to Snake-Men ruins, others were captured by Slavers on route to Invak.)

Finally the players find the Orange Citadel’s former “God”, the Frog Spawn Llothali. They killed the creature so hard I would end up having lots of discussions with them about whether the laser guns in the game were too over powered. Probably, but we never ended up changing any of the rules.

**Players:**

- Eric Boyd: Orange Julia, Orange Women Fighter
- [Beloch Shrike][nick]: Renoir, Red Man Fighter
- Dion: Asha-Rea, Ulfire Women Fighter
- Chris P: Bone Crone, Bone Women Sorcerer
- Terry: ???

**Recap:**

- Quiet in Invak, the party head south towards Jahar to inquire about raptor trainers and their staff. 
- On the way they encounter 11 Blue Men, one shouting about wanting their metal.
- They chase them off once they produce their armaments.
- In Jahar they learn their staff has the power to summon the evil old one Molkrom: the sage doesn’t know how exactly, but thinks vile sorcerers may.
- Merchants are readying themselves for a trip South to Cron.
- Head back to Invak to go after some slavers!
- No one will join them! Or will they?
- The Lawgiver of Winds joins the party after a rousing speech about slavery.
- Encounter a group of 12 slavers on the road while looking for the Slaver encampment!
- A battle breaks out, of course. The Slavers are aware of the Rainbow Connection and aren’t fans.
- Midway through the fight an old crone shows up, ready for battle! It's Chris P. 
- This battle is bloodier than most: almost no misses till the every end!
- A jerk ass slaver wounds Renoir, and makes his escape with 3 of his friends.
- Capture 7 slaver heads and the vaporized remains of another
- They find the slaver encampment. As they were told, it is a base built into a hillside. Slaves are chained up outside, and raptor mounted guards are outside.
- The party decides now isn’t the time to attack.
- They make their way over to the castle of decline, stopping along the way at the former Orange Men citadel. 
- Continuing to the Castle of Decline, they come to learn it has been abandoned. They aren’t sure where the Bone Men may have went, as Invak seems like the obvious choice.
- Meet 4 Red Men on the road back to the Former Orange Men citadel, who they escort with them.
- Head back to Invak without incident
- Oh, the party also killed the Llothali without breaking a sweat. What?
