I forgot the man himself Daniel Dean also made an appearance during this campaign. This might have been the only session he managed to play, but the nice thing about G+ was people would sometimes drop into games if they happened to be free on a particular night.

Eric and Gus had it in their minds to start building a keep, recruiting an army, and just moving on to a sort of domain type of play as they plan to go to war with the Jale Slavers. They had discovered their hide out in an earlier session. I hadn’t really thought through what that would look like. I made notes to myself to re-read the last OD&D book the Underworld & Wilderness Adventures to see what it had to say on the topic. Not bloody much, but it does tell you how much gold it takes to build a keep.

This session the party returns to the hidden citadel they had spent a few sessions trying and failing to enter, constantly battling Mi-Go in the process. Here they finally came face to face with another faction I had active in the region: the Protector of Truths and his war with the Mi-Go on the other side of Carcosa. [This is discussed in my Carcosa-style recap of the session.][s17] I hadn’t fleshed out much about what this Mi-Go war was even about, which was good because the players didn’t want to figure it out either.

We ended the session with a roll of 1 on the settlement hazard die. Next session the players would learn what transpired!

**Recap:**

- The party starts work on a small keep in Invak, recruiting some labourers to gather and repurpose materials.

- Hearing rumours about Mi-Go bothering the merchants the party head South to Jahar.
- Encounter 3 injured Blue Men in the wilderness.
- They heal them and bring them back to Jahar, who are really not too happy to be hosting random Blue Men within their walls.
- They return to the citadel, and climb through a large pane window to enter the Castle.
- They enter a large dorm style room, which they start to search when 6 Yellow Men walk in.
- Another Yellow Man, who appears to be a commander of some sort, and a Mi-Go join the fray.
- There is some talking, and then much fighting.
- The Mi-Go is killed. The leader flees down some stairs!
- 6 more Yellow Men join the fight.
- More murder, but then a call to stop fighting.
- The party meets the Protector of Truths, the person in charge of this Castle.
- They are fighting a war against the Mi-Go on the other side of Carcosa.
- They travel to the castle via a strange crystal device.
- They have been lobotomizing the Mi-Go and setting them free inside a cavern that connects to this castle, because of their leaders beliefs about killing.
- They are working with a handful of Mi-Go that are also fighting against this particular group of Mi-Go, for reasons unknown.
- He gives the party 1000GP gem as a ‘sorry for all the Mi-Go’ gift.

**Treasure:**

- 1 Black Gem (1000GP)

**Monsters Killed:**

- 5 Yellow Men
- 1 Migo

**Note:**

- Wandering monster check at the end of the session means future drama for the party! (I know what it’ll be.)
