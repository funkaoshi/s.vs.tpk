This session was all about trying to make friends. The players had a zany scheme: dress up a slaver in the space alien amour they had stolen from a tomb in order to convince the space aliens it was in fact the slavers that were out there desecrating their holy sites.

They once again returned to the Space Alien outpost, no longer abandoned. They had returned to their experiments, making use of the deranged, spherical, hunter robot that stakes the wastes at night. The Carcosa book has this to say about the robot, which is what I used as the seed for my ideas for the this whole space and how all the parts fit together: “It will seek to abduct stragglers and take them to a small, hidden outpost to be shackled in close proximity to radioactive waste. Each hour spent thus requires a successful saving throw to avoid mutation.”

This is the session Asha Rey dies! I remember the session, but don’t recall if this was a surprise round followed by an instant kill due to the dice. Harsh if so. In my head this game was a real meat grinder, but there weren’t actually that many player deaths over the course of the campaign.

Wish I could remember the context for, “Chris P gets 15XP for just being an all around great guy.” He really was, though.

**Players:** 

- [Gus][]: Normangina, Yellow Woman Fighter
- Eric Boyd: Orange Julia - Orange Women Fighter
- Chris P.: Bone Crone - Bone Women Sorcerer
- Dion: Asha-Rea, Ulfire Women Fighter

**Recap:**

- The party puts the space alien armour on one of the Jale Slaver bodies they killed and jam the body in a barrel with some salt and rocks to try and stop the body from decomposing too much.
- They travel south towards the space alien outpost, no looking much less abandoned.
- A group of space aliens—those the party "freed"—have gone to work repairing the outpost and continuing their experimentation.
- The spherical hunter robot exists to bring specimens to the wastes: they will consider turning it off, but promised to stop sending it West towards Jahar and Invak.
- The Aliens are far stranger than the ones you have met thus far. They seem cold and emotionless.
- The party gives them the heads up that people on Carcosa are fucked up, and then head on their way after learning the space alien strike force headed south east (towards their leaders tomb)
- As they get closer they see the same giant translucent T-Rex they saw last time they explored the tomb. It doesn't see them and wanders South.
- The space aliens are nowhere to be seen, but look to have headed south, so they head that was as well, taking care to avoid the dinosaur.
- They come upon the poisonous swamps, which stretch out for miles. The aliens are long gone, so they decide to head back and wait for them to return to the tomb.
- On the way back they spot 4 savage Mi-Go who dive out of the sky.
- Asha Rey is killed instantly — RIP
- The fight quickly turns, as the party manage to kill the Mi-Go one after another.
- They camp near the alien tomb, waiting for the space aliens.
- The aliens come upon them in the middle of the night.
- They show the aliens the armour on the slavers body.
- The space aliens are disgusted with what was done and will join their fight against the slavers.
- Led inside to sleep, but party elects to sleep outside
- No overnight drama, they awake safe and sound.
- The Space Alien Strike Force head North, planning to scope out the slavers.

**Treasure:**

- The good will of the Space Alien Strike Force
- Chris P gets 15XP for just being an all around great guy.

- **Ramanan S** (2016-03-16 04:09): Let me know if i've missed anything. I'll make an event thread for the next session. We can do the stuff that happens between sessions there.
- **Dion Williams** (2016-03-16 08:57): I was tempted to draw a picture of Asha-Ray exploding with the Mi-Go coming though "Chest Burster Xenomorph" style.
- **Ramanan S** (2016-03-17 05:27): Dion Williams do it!
