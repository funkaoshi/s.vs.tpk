The session began with exploration and learning more about the world. This was the first time the party got lost in the wilderness, an important part of the game. My travel rules worked. The party found more caves to explore in the future, and learned of a second citadel that purportedly held a tomb of vile sorceress magic—the best kind. The party would refuse to seek it out for the remainder of the game, of course. The later half of the session was spent getting high with some stoner Carcosans. Dion joined the game this session, and was a fixture in the campaign for a long time to come, playing Ulfire Sorcerer Asha-Rea. His character used the distraction of everyone getting high off their ass to steal some Jale Lotuses to sell later. A quiet session, but they can’t all be loud.

[You can contrast the recap that follows with my Carcosa-style hex descriptions.][s5]

**Players:**

- Dion: Asha-Rea, Ulfire Woman Sorcerer
- [Beloch Shrike][nick]: Renoir, Red Man Fighter

**Recap:**

- The party is in Invak, returning after vanquishing the cultists to the North.
- They elect to escort two of the bone from the the Citadel of Decline back home.
- Get lost on the way there, ending up South of Invak.
- Encounter Jale Slavers on the road. 17 in total and they look like bad asses.
- The party books it, escaping into the wilderness. They are forced to abandon a pack animal to do so.
- They spend the night in the wilderness and then head back to Invak.
- Once more, the party heads North West towards the citadel.
- The trip is uneventful, but on the way there hey find two caves to explore later.
- The citadel is as it was before. Lots of sad sack bone men and women.
- The party hears a rumour of a citadel to the south the bone men avoided when they stumbled upon this castle many years ago. This other citadel was also abandoned, but covered in sigils and markings that left everyone feeling disturbed. The scouting party who ventured within claimed to see a book of foul sorcery that so terrified them they turned and ran he moment they set their eyes upon it.
- The party rests the night and heads towards Invak, stopping at cavern on the way.
- It's home to stoner brown men, who snort Jale lotus and receive visions.
