I was in England over the last couple weeks to visit my brother. As has become somewhat of a tradition, I met up with [Patrick][] at [Warhammer World][ww] in Notthingham. This time we were also joined by [Chris][]. He drove down from Manchester, so was able to cart us off to Bryan Ansell's retirement project, The Foundry. Ansell turned part of his home (I think) into this storefront and museum for OldHammer style miniatures. I picked up some pirates I may try and use in the next Mordheim league. The minuatures they had on display were really quite amazing. The store is small, but very dense. There are so many metal minis, it's kind of overwhelming.

We also did the tour of Warhammer World exhibition space. There are lots of dioramas on display that are really quite incredible. It's well worth checking out if you're in the UK and love Warhammer. I hadn't been since 2017, and there were lots of new minis and dioramas for me to enjoy, and even the old ones continue to impress.
