## 0720

Al'az Zulg, God of Misogyny and Shame, grows in power with each self-destructive sacrifice its followers proffer. Its material form is that of a gigantic, nude, bloated, floating, hermaphroditic human. Its followers, in Hex 0719, must carefully lower sacrifices in to its gaping maw, for Al'az Zulg is above all things lazy and won't exert itself even to eat.

## 0801

Each and every day the volcano TEPETL QUIAUTL belches forth the blackest of black molten obsidian. Cuetzpalin, Sword of the Evening Star, Leader of the Free-Men of Hex 1003, is said to wield a magical sword forged from the obsidian of this volcano.

## 0802

This mountainous area is covered by a thick, black smog, being a mixture of the fumes from TEPETL QUIAUTL in Hex 0801 and the spores from Hex 0703.

Sir Gregor La Scala has gathered his ragtag army of converted locals and odd foreigners to &quot;Bring Peace, Order, and True Faith to the land.&quot; In hused tones is speculation of his true age and how he liberated much power for Jupiter's Glory from the mighty Djinni (see Hex 0304).

## 0808

A group of Ram-Horned spies are making their way North to get information on Sir Gregor La Scala's forces in Hex 0805.

## 0809

## 0913

Sand Goblin hunters stalk 52 Ram-horned Marhaban riding great insects across the dune hills on their way to join the forces in Hex 0909. The Sand Goblins have trapped many areas and left light valuables resting on patches of quicksand. They are violating a treaty.

## 1006

The shadow of an invisible staircase reveals it's location but doesn't make it any easier to climb once you're on it.

## 1014

The sand here is hard-packed and easy to travel over. The dunes are also not so high here and provide great visibility southward to Hex 1015. The dunes are reduced in size by Wasp-men that make their homes in the hard pack. They are mortal enemies with the Scorpion-men in Hex 1012.

## 1015

Four obelisks surround a low mound. The images tell of the great evil buried there, the perils of joining the hemispheres, and the Wasp-men who have protected it since ancient times.

## 1020

## 1112

The sand here is glassy and sheer in places. This area is profoundly dangerous for the shifting, cracking glass-sands and the jets of super-heated magma that erupt randomly.

## 1113

Every now and then, this volcano gets fitful and fretful, and buries the surrounding communities. It really only wants a friend, though. Someone to sing to it. If only someone would give a bit of love, it would totally stop asploding every so often. <br /><br />(The Needy Volcano may be influenced by the powerful spirit of the First Child, a powerful ghost of the very first sacrifice ever made to the volcano. It loves music.)

## 1114

Grand Prelate Glyphilius Inkswell, mortal representantive of Libria, goddess of knowledge, has taken residence in a tent here at the banks of the river. His 15 acolytes make scrolls from paper harvested in Hex 1115 which they offer to buy from passers-by.

Dolphin mating grounds.

## 1201

The groundwork here resembles the outline of the volcano in Hex 1101. Further investigation shows gigantic tread tracks to the unknown north, and bits and pieces of strange metal sticking out of the floor. If seen from space, looks like a failed terraforming installation.

## 1202

Rock platforms provide just enough footing over the lava to a crystal tube a mile out that leads under. A cache of powerful weapons is in there, but Fire Mephits and Lava Oozes protect it.

A boy shepherds a flock of burrowing owls that scamper off, burrow, and return with something. They've been trained to hunt insects and smaller animals and to collect anything shiny or metal; there is a chance the boy may have collected something of great value.

## 1415

Magical wards conceal and lock the solid gold doors that lead into ACAMAPICHTLI, the majestic subterranean capital city of the long dead Snake-men. These are the only doors into the city, keeping that which destroyed the Snake-men trapped within.

## 1416

A freestanding door at the end of an ancient road is inscribed with runes that are the instructions for a ritual. If completed and the clay pot from Hex 0408 is used to open the door, an army of 333 Snake-men will emerge and begin marching Northwest. They will not enter their former capital city in Hex 1415, but will tell of many riches locked therein.

## 1417

The air is thick with sulfurous fumes as a relatively new volcano pulses lava steadily to the south. Lava Oozes break away from the stream to hunt, and twisted coal men capture slaves with tridents. Pieces of the a military outpost and armory of ACAMAPICHTLI Hex 1415 are buried amongst the rocks.

## 1506

Within this hex there is a single 100 foot tall evergreen tree standing among the dunes. Standing at the base of the tree at mid-day every day for seven days and staring into the sun through the branches for one hour will permanently blind the observer, but also allow them to cast, once per day, a fireball spell, as a caster of one level less than the character (arcane casters can even scribe the spell into a spell book/scroll as if they had successfully researched it). They will also know one of the names of the sun (see Hex 0319).

## 1507

At the bottom of a large dune the corpse of a Snake-man baby will tell of the future or past in the cracked voice of 1,000 years of doom to any casting shade upon it.

A strange flock of white pygmy deer forage in the weeds along a dry riverbed. A two-headed boy sits on a rock and watches over them.

## 1511

## 1515

A crashed airship. Its cargo is silver ingots. Stirges and biting insects nest near the thin trickle of water which condenses against the ship's shiny skin.

An aerie of malevolent harpies inhabits the peaks of this mountain range, harrying any travelers in the surrounding low areas.

## 1601

Centuries of laborers toiling to bring ice down from the &quot;Old Men&quot; have packed and smoothed the snow covered earth in to a natural luge track. Daredevils risk yeti and ice troll attacks on the way up for the thrill of the miles long ride to the bottom.

## 1602

Shadowed by mountains part of the day and receiving rain from a weather fluke (see conditions in Hex 1601), these few miles of scrubland are tended as the holy site of ~6ft intelligent mantises.

## 1608

Half buried in the sands here is the Pyramid of The Serpent Headed Prophet. Though looted of its original treasures millennium ago, the pyramid, when it hasn't been forgotten under sands, has periodically served as base of operations for one group of undesirables or another, most recently, to a particularly bloodthirsty and brutally effective gang of bandits led by the nomad turned assassin, Kamal the Killer, who wields the deadly blade "Spiller of the Silver Blood."

## 1609

The Great Wyrm of Gloom, Techatnazl, burrows endlessly here, causing shifting sands, uncertain footing, and no end of sadness in the slave quarters of the far reaches of the Northern Outpost of the Great Empire of KARAKT-ZUL directly to the East.

## 1701

Didjeet, leader of a rogue faction of the Mantises from Hex 1602, has taken refuge here in the mountains after a failed coup d'Ã©tat over the elders. He believes the scrubland should be used for profit, while the elders merely police the land allowing outsiders to just take their water.

## 1702

A lone Iron Golem lays inert in the brush, part of a long forgotten expedition to the North. It can be reanimated if sufficient magical energy is expended in its presence, forever serving the first person it sees.

## 1703

Qullan raiders swarm around a great hive structure made from sand and spit. At the top, 30 ft up and growing, some of them emerge with wasps' wings and stingers. The Qullans of Hex 1306 and Hex 1504 came from this camp, but would find it much changed recently.

## 1704

An underground lava flow from Hex 1805 has reached an oasis here. The waters have become fouled and undrinkable. However, it has become a very comfortable natural hot spring.

## 1710

The crumbling remains of very ancient palace. At night, undead shadows roam this place, despondently trying to reenact their lives, but passing of time and the influence of Techanazl in Hex 1609 have caused them to forget much of what living was, though not their hatred for those that still live.

Here the marilith Semyaza has taken over a wizard's tower after a summoning gone wrong.

Here, along the ruins of a mountain fort, where great herds of swine feed on grounds fertilized by a terrible battle is where Yonian, giant razor-back of legend, has made its home.

YAT, is a village of fisher folk and mountain men near the mouth of a river. The hunters here know of Yonian in Hex 2011.

The mouth of a cave conceals an enormous hanger for airships. This is Karesh Kazel's Ship Works. His creations are among the finest in the land and he creates beautiful luxury ships for the nobels of TEKHAT MAL (Hex 1812)

## 2014

The Imperial Seat of The Great Empire of KARAKT-ZUL floats high above the waters here on waves of magical energy being subtly sapped from the Sandstone Elementals of Hexes 1815 and 1916, though none now living know this or much else of the ancient magics of this tremendous and beautiful &quot;City Above the Sea.&quot; Transport to and from the city is accomplished in giant scarab styled gondolas lifted by Rocs charmed and thus controlled by the Illustrious Vizier of the Aires. The beautiful Seranda el Teran, cousin to the Emperor, is the current holder of the powerful Amulet of Aire which confers this title and such control over Rocs, she will thus pay handsomely for the hatchlings of the Rocs in Hex 0508 or simply information about such.

## 2015

The water here is extremely deep almost impossibly deep. At the bottom lurks some beast only knows as &quot;the deep one&quot;

## 2016

Several nuns from the DAUGHTER OF THE MOUNTAIN MONASTERY (Hex 1917) frolic in the shallows here. A reef of iridescent coral can be seen beneath the water. The coral is harvested by the nuns and made into enchanted jewelry. If anyone attempts to vex the nuns, a giant golem made of Coral will rise from the water and attack.

## 2017

For the Giant Dragonflies and Wasps that breed in the fungus of Hex 2018 the water here is a portal to Hex 0819 of Hexenbracken, and they fly back and forth often; this will work for any that ride them, although they are not easily tamed. For any not riding a Giant Dragonfly from this area it is a normal sea inlet.

## 2018

An old building made of decaying books is overtaken by the fungal forest; a few spellbooks can still be harvested. Eating the fungus here causes nausea and hallucinations, but at the end of a month one will grow small dragonfly wings and be able to use the waters of Hex 2017 as a portal once per day. The Giant Dragonflies and Wasps of Hex 2017 breed and feed here, but mainly live in the neighboring hexes.

## 2019

Cytorrak, sorcerer and ancient nemesis of the wizard in Hex 1920 sails with a ship full of jackal-headed men to destroy his foe at last. He has no idea of the situation his foe has gotten himself into, and he will be confused.
