Last year Prismatic Wasteland ran a cool little tournament of sorts called the [Bloggies][2022], where he picked an initial pool of really cool blog posts, and then had people vote to crown the best blog post of the year. [Zedeck won last year][winner], and so was tasked to [continue the tradition into 2023][2023]. And so the Bloggies 2023 have begun. [The first round of voting is taking place now, with a set of 16 posts on RPG theory.][vote]
