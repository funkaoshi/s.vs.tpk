[Clayton][] has done an amazing job organizing the [Bloggies][] this year. Everything is neatly organized on his blog, with little infographics to help you follow along with what's happening and what you need to to participate. The first round of voting is happening _right now_. As before there are four main categories: advice, reviews, gameable, and theory. He's added a new 'meta' category, to highlight posts that are a little bit meta. There are too many good blog posts, and Clayton has done a great job making some thematic and Sophie's Choice match ups? How are you supposed to choose between [The OSR Onion][osr-1]  vs. [What is an OSR?][osr-2] That was my hardest pick this round.
