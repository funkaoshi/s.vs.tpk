![Chapter Serf](/assets/img/chapter-serfs.jpg)

[Zedeck Siew has finished his RPG about the background characters you find in the world of Warhammer 40,000.][1] Your characters live in servitude to five Space Marines aboard the Warmask of Gloriana, where your characters are tasked to ferry them to their next engagement. [Chapter Serfs][3] is exactly the sort of RPG I love: to the point and focused. There are just enough words and no more. The setting of this ship is brought to life via a couple sentences afforded to each of the possible backgrounds for your characters, the rules themselves and what they tell you about the world, the leaders of the various factions aboard the ship and the tasks they will ask you to perform, etc. The ship is mapped out for the players to explore. This is all a self contained game, ready to be played. [My friend Tim shared his thoughts about it as well for Wargamer.][2]
