[An interesting post from Clayton][1] discusses what he calls Dominant Mechanics: “[Dominant Mechanics][1] are rules that cannot co-exist in a system without monopolizing play and overriding other rules.” My favourite example of this would be skill checks in later editions of Dungeons and Dragons. This idea relates to one of [my big complaints about 4E][2], where your characters various powers end up being the sum total of play.
