[Over at Prismatic Wasteland Warren discusses how to make sure your D&D encounters are their most impactful.][1] I am a big fan of practical DM'ing advice like this. You could write out his check list on a post-it note and refer to it when prepping a dungeon or an encounter table. If you need to quickly improvise something you could pick one of the elements he suggests and lean into that.
