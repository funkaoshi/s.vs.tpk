I recently shared my [Gygax 75 draft][0] and was complimented on putting a Dragon as the last entry on the example encounter table for the region. I stole this idea from my friend Nick, who wrote I feel is the best blog post on this topic: [Structuring Encounter Tables, Amended & Restated.][1]. A nice follow up blog post is [this Encounter Checklist from Prismatic Wasteland][2], which breaks down elements you should keep in mind when trying to build an interesting an effective encounter for your players.
