[Nick writes about one of my favourite video games, and probably the most difficult Final Fantasy game in its series, FF1.][1] It's an excellent game, and wears its D&D inspiration quite heavily on its sleeve. The monsters are so clearly taken from the Monster Manual. It even has Vancian magic! It's genuinely challenging. I remember having to try some dungeons several times. Resource management plays such a heavy role in this game, something that became far less important as the series would move on. Nick discusses how it's probably the most OSR of all the FF games.
