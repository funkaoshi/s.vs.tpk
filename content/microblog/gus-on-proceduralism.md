> These notes and Arneson's would ultimately become Dungeons & Dragons, but only by being codified could the game really be propagated and begin to gather a following. This same problem persists for designers today.

[Gus has written a long essay on procedures in gaming][1], why they mater, and a mode of thinking about games he calls Proceduralism. One could call this tract of thinking [the Pahvelorn School of Game Design][2]. As it was for Gus, [that campaign][3] was so inspirational for me. It really shaped how I think and play games now, all these years later. I had bugged Gus to break this post up, there is so much here, and a lot of it could stand by itself, but he said "no way!" A man's gotta have a code, I suppose.
