I had been not so patiently for my copy of [Into the Odd][ito] to arrive. [Chris] teamed up with [Johan Nohr][jn] of [Mörk Borg][mb] fame to produce this new edition of the game. They have made a really incredible book together, it's really quite beautiful. My love of this system has grown slowly over time. Paolo published Wonder and Wickedness and Into the Odd around the same time, but I next to no interest in the game. The implied setting seemed wasn't really to my taste. Also, I was all about OD&D at the time. Over the years, perhaps with the release of Silent Titans, I have become much more aware and interested in Chris's works. He's one of my favourite OSR game designers now, and Into the Odd seems like one of the more important and influential works to have come out of the OSR.
