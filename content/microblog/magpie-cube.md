I haven't played Magic: The Gathering seriously since High School, though I stil have many of my cards and decks from the 90s. (Sadly most everything I have are the sorts of cards that no one cares about, nevermind my cards are hardly pristine.) [Reading Jay Dragon talk about a diffferent format for playing the game, what he's dubbed the Magpie Cube, was really facinating.][1] I was only vaguely aware of the cube format of organizing games, which Jay sums up before expanding upon in ways game design nerds will surely enjoy. Briefly, you and your friends play magic games drafting cards from a very small fixed pool of cards. If you're already playing Magic and want to make it feel more fresh, this seems like a great approach. This format also feels like it strips away the whole pay-to-play aspect of the game. Every so often I'll see something about Magic and feel this energy trying to pull me back in. Thus far I've always resisted: not today, satan!
