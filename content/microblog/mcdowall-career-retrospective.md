[While we are on the topic of Chris][1], I really enjoyed [his recent career retrospective][2]. I shared it on BlueSky, but need to get better at just posting stuff here.[^1] It’s easy to look at Chris’s recent success with [Mythic Bastionland][8] and ignore the slow burn that brought him to this point. I have mentioned many times now that when [Into the Odd][3] came out I really wasn’t paying it much attention. For whatever reason [Electric Bastionland][4] [captured my attention][5]. (Likely [Alec’s][6] part play’s a big role there.) As time has moved on from the early 2010s, [Into the Odd][7] feels like it has become one of the most influential games to come out of the scene. It’s funny [you can be right next to something important][7] and just not pay it any attention, because you already have OD&D at home.

[^1]: BlueSky feels like it could implode at any moment, it has a lot of Twitter drama energy.
