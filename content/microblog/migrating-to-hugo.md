For work I need to learn how people are using generative AI tools like Claude and Copilot to write software. I thought a good practical experiment would be to migrate this site's backend from Jekyll to Hugo, something I have wanted to do for a long time. This is fussy busy work: moving files around, renaming them all, changing the front matter on my posts to match Hugo's format, etc. These are all things I could write scripts and programs to do with time and some thought, but each time I have thought about doing so in the past I decided I would rather do anything else. Claude looks to have done a good enough job here. This is work I find uninteresting, but that a computer has no emotion about. This is pretty mechnanical work. Invisible and uncreative. I'm curious if my (very negative) feelings about AI will change having it build something interesting and novel. That's my next experiment, unrelated to this blog.
