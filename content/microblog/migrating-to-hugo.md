For work I need to learn how people are using generative AI tools like Claude and Copilot to write software. I thought a good practical experiment would be to migrate this site's backend from [Jekyll][] to [Hugo][], something I have wanted to do for a long time. This is fussy busy work: moving files around, renaming them all, changing the front matter on my posts to match Hugo's format, etc. These are all things I could write scripts and programs to do with time and some thought, but each time I have thought about doing so in the past I decided I would rather do anything else. And so I let the robots give it a go. Claude looks to have done a good enough job here. This is work I find uninteresting, but that a computer has no emotion about: mechanical, invisible, and uncreative. [We are in a real moment right now.][syntax] Please let me know if I've broken my site. Would serve me right for using AI.
