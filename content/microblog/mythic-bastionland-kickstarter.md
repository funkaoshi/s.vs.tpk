The [Mythic Bastionland Kickstarter][1] is wrapping up today. For those unfamiliar this is the Arthurian take on Chris's games Into the Odd and Electric Bastionland. I've been excited about this game since he first started talking about it, as it ties into my interests in this genre. (You may recall my aborted attempt to create a vaguely Arthurian / Dark Souls setting many months ago now: [The Misericorde][2].) Chris is working with Alec Sorensen, and the art they have shared so far looks really incredible. My friend Alex was [running the playtest version of this game][3] when it was first announced, and we had a fun time questing around the hexcrawl he created. The game works well, and I assume knowing Chris it's only been tightened up and improved upon since first announced. He's one of my favourite game designers. This will be great.
