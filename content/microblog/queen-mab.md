Patrick's launched his latest Kickstarter, [Queen Mabs Palace][1]. In a real plot twist, the book isn't a D&D module, but a novel. I suppose novels were the first adventures. I'm reading Patrick's last book now, [Gackling Moon][2], which is a gazeteer for [the Wodlands][3], a weird fantasy setting. It reminds me the Wanderer's Journal from Dark Sun: pure vibes. There is some gaming material in the book, but it feels there is maybe _just_ enough to still call it a gaming book and not have people moan too much. In many ways it's the setting book version of [Fire on the Velvet Horizon][4]. I should say more here, but just wanted to point out that Queen Mabs Palace feels like the natural follow up to a book like Gackling Moon, perhaps.
