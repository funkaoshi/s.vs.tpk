[Sam Pearson][yt] is the person behind two of Games Workshop’s greatest games: [Warcry][] & Spearhead. He has recently started [a YouTube channel][yt] after ending his time at the company as one of their lead game designers. So far the videos are all straight up bangers, but he’s recently shared three videos on game design that are worth watching in particular:

- [Meaningful Player Choice][1]
- [Designing Warhammer (or any Wargame) Rules][2]
- [Create Professional Looking Wargames][3]

Meaningful Player Choice is an incredible discussion on game design, whether you’re interested in war-games or not. The last video is about turning your ideas into a polished product. This is all top tier! Enjoy.
