![My Electrum Archive character sheet](/assets/img/the-electrum-archive-breakout-con.jpg)

I met up with [Emiel][] and [Ava][] shortly after they arrived in Toronto for [Breakout Con][breakout]. I love to see my D&D friends in real life: that’s what it’s all about. (Our meetup also included Jon, the Retired Adventurer, who lives so close to me it’s embarrassing I only see him when Ava is in town.) I managed to see them a few times before they left, ending my convention crashing a game Ava ran of *[The Electrum Archive][tea-01]*. We played through an adventure that was intended to be part of [the second zine][tea-02], but which was cut for space—the zine was already massive. The adventure was a lot of fun, so I’m looking forward to its release. In *The Electrum Archive* the typical dungeons are the crashed spaceships of an ancient people. Our characters were sent to find a missing posse of soldiers who were exploring one such ship. We would discover they had all been murdered like something out of Alien. The adventure included: someone gaining telepathy; the rest of the party not clueing into how that happened, and instead gaining random crap mutations; a giant mech suit that ended the session just hulk smashing stuff; lots of sphincters; blood, guts and gore. So, all the good stuff.
