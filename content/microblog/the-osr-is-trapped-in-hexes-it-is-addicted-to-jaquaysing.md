[Press the Beast shared a criticism I enjoyed of some parts of the OSR, and the obsession with products as the output of the hobby.][1] The post is a bit of a rant—to put it mildly—but I also think it's good advice all the same. When I was posting [my Carcosa session recaps][2], notes, and [advice][3], I was trying to highlight just how little I had done to make that game go. It shouldn't take much to start playing!
