[Jason Tochi][1] of [24XX][2] fame wrote a great post a little while ago about what he calls [the three layers of rules][3]: social, fictional, and abstract. If you're interested in game design it's a great way to think about things, especially in more rules light games. Where do the unspoken rules go? Probably to the social and fictional layers. This post is in the news again as Jason [shared a version][4] included in the rules for his new game, [Alight][5].
