![Mac Attack at the Pub](/assets/img/mac-attack-pub.jpg)

I mail a lot of books to my brother in the UK. There were a few books waiting for me when I arrived in London this morning. One of those books was [Chris McDowall’s][cm] latest war-game, [MAC ATTACK][ma]. This is a 6mm scale sci-fi war-game, essentially Chris’s take on the venerable mech game. These sorts of games are typically quite crunchy, so [it’s interesting to see how Chris distills battling mechs to its true essence][1]. I had expected the book to be bigger. It’s a cute little thing. An A5 perfect bound softcover. You can pack this in your backpack without breaking a sweat.

The rules for MAC ATTACK are captured over four pages that open the book. The first introduces some core concepts of the game, in particular motion and heat, two attributes of each mech. (Or should I say MAC? I won’t, but these things are called MACs.) Motion tracks the sort of movement the mech has made: faster movement makes you harder to hit, but also makes it harder for you to hit other mechs. Heat tracks how hot your mech is getting. If it hits 6 you overheat! The second page explains how battlefields and terrain work. The third and forth page are effectively the rules for the whole game. He’s done it again!

A turn in MAC ATTACK is broken up in to 4 phases. An initiative deck is created with each unit being assigned a card. Draw cards to see who gets to activate. During the move phase you’ll move your mechs, and in the process assign them their motion dice. Depending on the sort of movement action they take, they might gain some heat. The movement phase is followed by the attack phase. The initiative deck is shuffled and the players once again draw cards to see which unit will activate and fight. To fight you will roll a number of attack dice dictated by your mech’s weapon. The target number to be rolled on each dice is determined by summing both units motion dice. The roll can be modified if the target is crashed, in cover, or inside a building. A 1 is always a miss, a 6 is always a hit. Hits are assigned to the various modules that make a mech, which will destroy them over the course of the game. Hits that would hit a destroyed module instead cause internal damage to the mech. This feels like a pretty elegant combat system. Once all the mechs have had a chance to activate in the attack phase, you will destroy any mechs who have taken more internal damage than their class. You’ll learn what a mech’s class is by turning the page and reading the rules for making MACs. Dealing with damage in this way means you’ll never have your mechs blown off the board before they have a chance to cause some damage themselves. The turn closes with a cooldown phase. The mechs all lower their heat score based on their mech’s class, modified by whether they have radiator or coolant modules, or are sitting in water. And that is that! The book concludes with pages and pages of advanced rules, variant ways to play, etc, if you want to expand on this simple base.

The next few pages cover building your mechs, buying the weapons and hardware that will make each unique. There are several factions described in the book. The lore for the setting is basically a couple pull quotes per faction, their example units, and the (amazing) art from [Amanda Lee Franck][alf]. It’s impressive how you can get across within those tight constraints. Like [the Doomed][td], the expectation is you’re kit bashing your mechs, taking Battletech minis and mixing them with junk you have laying about your house. The game also has rules for taking your little epic scale infantry and tanks, perfect if you’ve picked up Legion Imperialis like myself.

Rather than bespoke scenarios, Chris has a scenario generator like War Cry, where you will generate your deployment, victory conditions (for each side) and a twist. You could use the generator, and the advanced rules at the back of the book, to come up with interesting narrative scenarios.

I’ll need to figure out the simplest way to get this game to the table. Maybe I can find some mechs in the used bins at the Sword and Board? Maybe I can use some Tyranids as Kaiju? I’ll have to report back once I’ve played the game. (It does have solo rules, so you don’t even have to play with any other dorks.) This is the first mech game I’ve read that feels compelling enough to play. Most feel way too fussy. I think that’s the mouth feel most people want with these sorts of games, but this feels like it might be a good compromise. You have a lot of granularity still, but seemingly without a lot of the complexity. Will have to play and see if that is how it all pans out.
