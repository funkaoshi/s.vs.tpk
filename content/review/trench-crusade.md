I finally took my posse of Heretic Legion models and played a game of [Trench Crusade][tc] with [Raff][] at [the Sword and Board][sb]. Trench Crusade was created by [Mike Franchina][mf], the main artist for the game. The rules were designed by the legend himself, Tuomas Pirinen, of [Mordheim][] fame. There is so much to love about this game, where to begin?

Trench Crusade takes place in an alternate version of earth where rogue Knight Templars open a gate to hell and the the next 800 years or so are all about people fighting demons and that sort of nonsense. The game’s present day is 1914, the start of our WWI, just another day in this worlds never-ending war. Mike Franchina’s artwork helps bring the setting to life, elevating it beyond just another Weird World War sort of game.

The rules for the game are nice and simple. There is a single resolution mechanic: roll 2d6 and try to score above a 7. A 12 is a critical success. The number of dice you roll can be modified based on a model’s profile, equipment, situational rules, etc. In such cases you’ll add additional dice to your dice pool. The rules refer to this as +DICE and -DICE. A +1 DICE and a -1 DICE cancel each other out, so you’ll end up with a pool that contains 0 or more +1 DICE or -1 DICE. This then works like advantage or disadvantage in D&D: you will roll all your dice and take the highest two, or the lowest two, depending on the make up of your dice pool. This is the roll you’ll make to shoot or attack. You’ll also make a roll like this when taking ‘risky actions’, like trying to climb a wall or make a diving charge. If you shooting or melee attack is successful, you will make a similar roll on an injury table. Rolling a 9+ takes a model out of action. A 7-8 will knock the model down. A 2-8 will also cause the model to gain a blood token. These can be spent to modify die roles. The opposing player can spend them to make your unit less effective in combat, or make their own units more effective when targeting that model. All in all it’s a nice and tidy system: it’s fast to play. 

There is almost no looking anything up, no complicated tables, etc. There is far less rolling lots of dice to accomplish nothing, a common feature of Mordheim. You don’t have to track wounds, as there is no hit points. Tougher units will have an armour score that reduces the results of the injury die, making them more likely to survive. The blood tokens act a little like wound markers, as a unit with blood tokens will be easier to kill in subsequent attacks, but it’s dynamic and not a sure thing. In our game we I was constantly spending the tokens I had inflicted on Raff’s elite demon monsters to make them less effective in combat, trying hard to keep my little heretic troopers alive. I also managed to get some lucky rolls, resulting in one of troopers almost killing Raff’s super-demon. That model is Tough, so when it would be taken out of action the first time it’s simply knocked down. It got back up and demolished that little trooper on its next turn.

We played a one-shot, but as soon as it was done I wanted to start a campaign. The rules look very similar to Mordheim. The models in your warband can get injured, explore, level up, buy new equipment, etc. I’ll need to dig into all of that later. The book also has a healthy set of scenarios that look quite good. The default assumption is players will play 12 games in a sort of escalation league, the last game being the final free for all conclusion to the campaign. You start the campaign with a 700 ducats spending limit, and a limit of 10 models on your team. You end the campaign with a limit of 1800 and 22 models. You could field quite the platoon.

[The rules are available online for free][rules]—fantastic. The digital rule book takes advantage of the format, with hyperlinks to help you navigate through the document with ease. There is way finding in the left side margin of each page, to help orient your place in the book, but which also serve as hyperlink navigation through the book. The layout and design is lovely. The rules are well written and clear. There is a simple presentation of the rules that takes up about 8 pages and explains the whole game. This is followed up by a longer presentation of the rules which goes into a little more detail, providing additional clarity and examples. The simple rules are likely all you’ll need to read to play if you’re familiar with war-games, or need to refresh yourself on how the game works. Seeing a rulebook like this from a small indie company makes Games Workshop’s “we only sell you overpriced hardcover books that are out of date when you buy them” stance extra annoying.

I currently have enough models to do about 800 points. Evan kitbashed a Commando for me, which I’ll need to prime and paint. I want to try and kitbash more troops as well. Get to a point I could field a bigger posse for a bigger game.

I’m hopefully we will start a campaign in the city, and I can experience the fuller game. This game certainly is meant to be experienced as a long running campaign. That said, as it stands the rules work well for a fast standalone game. This is a solid skirmish game. Well worth checking out. I mean, it’s free!
