_The Imperium had named the planet Perthium 2-9-9, its discovery part of the second expedition to this sector, the 9th planet of the 9th system they found. The Battle Sisters of The Caedis Mission had dubbed the planet Gore, in honour of their early sorties with the insectoid xenos they first encountered upon landing on the planet. Unknown to The Caedis Mission, it was the Necron’s of the Kuruva Dynasty that wrested control of this planet back from the forces of Chaos that spilled forth when the galaxy was torn in two by the great rift._

## The Sisters Battle

### 1. A Safe Path October 3rd

_Sangami and her squad encounter a patrol of Necrons as they explore a ruined settlement. They must make their way to safety._ 

Played the Trail Blaze mission from the GRIMLITE rule book, more or less straight up.

**Aftermath**: All of the units were taken out of action! **Navira** was killed in battle (1). **Sangami** and **Emi** each gained a skill (6). **XVID 01** is currently MIA (4), while **SDAC 07** miraculously recovered from his grievous injuries (2). The Caedis Mission recovered 3 Glory, which earned them 1 new recruit, the Arco-Flagellant JDS 02, and a Servo Skull to protect sister Emi. These were clearly stragglers who have now caught up to the squad.

### 2. Left for Dead October 4th

_Sangami and her squad of Battle Sisters have been left for dead by the Necrons that have awoken on Perthium 2-9-9. They must first regroup and reach high ground to get a message out._ 

**Deployment:** Divide the board in the 4 quadrants and roll a d4 for each unit, placing the unit in the quadrant indicated, if possible outside of line of sight from any other friendly models. All models begin the game down. MIA models join the mission on the second round, entering from a random board edge. 

**Horrors:** Deploy 6 lesser horrors, rolling a d4 to pick which quadrant they deploy within. Place them as close to the centre of the quadrant as possible.

**Left for Dead:** Horrors will not target a character that is down until they have made an initial recovery roll.

**Glory:** Place 4 Glory tokens off-board. Gain 1 Glory at the end of the turn two friendly units touch for the first time. You can only withdraw once you have gained 3 or more Glory, or this requirement becomes impossible to fulfill.

**Aftermath**: The Sisters of Battle manage to regroup (earning 4 Glory), though the Arco-Flagellants **SDAC 07** and **JDS 02** are both killed in action. **Emi** is scarred by a near brush with death (and earns 1 Glory). In total the squad recovers 7 Glory: for the next battle only your leader gains the lunge tactic; for the next battle only your units can use the Phalanx tactic; requisition another Arco-Flagellant **JDS 03**, and for the next battle only the squad is joined by Sister of Battle **Selvi**.

### 3. Recon October 4th

_Sister Sangami and her squad attempt to learn about the enemy and what has brought them to Gore._

**Deployment:** The Sisters of Battle begin on a random board edge. Place an investigation marker in each quadrant of the board, and another in the centre.

**Horrors:** Deploy 1 Greater Horrors and 3 lesser horrors near the centre of the board.

**Glory:** Place 4 Glory tokens off-board. A unit touching an investigation marker can choose to spend an action to investigate. Make a quality roll to succeed, with a +1 to the roll if you are touching an ally. When you successfully investigate gain one Glory and remove the investigation marker from the board. 

**Aftermath:** I played this game 3 times—I had nothing else to do on Sunday night.

*   **First game:** A successful reconnaissance mission: all of Sagami’s squad survived. She fought of a Necron Destoryer and lived to tell the tale. The squad earned 4 Glory by successfully investigating 4 times. (_Was using Troika initiative straight up, 2 greater horrors.)_
*   **Second game:** A successful reconnaissance mission: all of Sagami’s squad survived. XVID 01 was scarred by the experience of coming face to face with a Necron Destroyer (gain 1 Glory). The squad earned 4 additional Glory by successfully investigating 4 times. (_Was using Troika initiative without an end of round card, 2 greater horrors.)_
*   **Third game**: A successful reconnaissance mission: all of Sagami’s squad survived, though the battle was quite tough. Sagami was scarred by the experience, nearly killed by the rending beam of a Necron Warrior (gain 1 Glory). XVID 01 seems to have become more formidable after the lessons learned this fight: perhaps some latent sentience still exists in the poor fellow (gain 1 skill). The squad earned 2 additional Glory by successfully investigating 2 times.  (_Was using Troika initiative without an end of round card, 1 greater horror and 3 lesser horrors, as both games with 2 horrors felt a bit easy.)_

Spending the 3 Glory, the squad keeps **Selvi** for another battle and spends 2 points on gear for **Emi**.

### 4. Cut off the Head October 5th

![Necron Royal Warden](../grimlite-6.jpg)

_The sisters reconnaissance has paid off, and they have a chance to take the fight to Necrons!_

**Deployment:** Divide each board edge by 2, and roll a d8 to decide which section of a board edge a unit deploys touching. The Sisters of Battle have the Necrons surrounded. MIA units join the game in the second round.

**Horrors:** Deploy 1 Royal Warden, 1 Greater Horror and 2 Lesser Horrors in the centre of the board.

**Glory:** Gain 2 Glory if the Royal Warden is taken out of action. Randomly place a “planning” token on the board for each investigation token you gained last game. If a unit is touching a planning token at the end of the turn, remove it from play, gain 1 Glory, and the unit gains a +1 bonus to their quality for this game.

**Aftermath**: 

*   **First game:** The entire squad was wiped out, recovering one planning token, ending with Selvi vs. the Royal Warden one on one. 
*   **Second game:** The entire squad was wiped out, recovering one planning token, ending with the Royal Warden killing the last XVID 01. (Adamant as it currently exists is too powerful for the wounds scheme.)
*   **Third game:** The entire squad was wiped out, recovering both planning tokens, ending with the Royal Warden killing the last JDS 02. (_Replaced Adamant with Eternal)_

**Sister Sangami** and **Emi** are trapped by the Necrons! The Arco-Flagellant **JDS 02** seems even more inflamed and violent post-battle, the narcotics cocktail to keep her calm before the next battle must be doubled (Retaliation, free action at the start of the next battle). **XVID 01** is missing in action. **Selvi** returns to the Caedis Mission after serving with Sangami’s squad. Perhaps they will meet again.
