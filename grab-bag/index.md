There is a lot of creative output on the internet. This page collects some of that work, mostly because I was unhappy with the original presentation of things, or because I wanted to test or try something out.

* The original crowd sourced hex maps: [The Hexenbracken][1], [The Kraal][2], [The Colossal Wastes of Zhaar][3]. Jacob Hurst organized one a little later, that produced [Synthexia][12].
* [The He-Man Show Bible][4] by Michael Halperin.
* [My 'beta' rules for OD&D Psionics][5]
* The infamous and notorious [PHILOTOMYâ€™S Dungeons and Dragons Musings][6] by Jason Cone.
* [Adam Taylor][7] giant list of spells for both [wizards][8] and [clerics][9], that you can filter by school and level. It's fantastic.
* [Zak Smith][10] on [Storygames and the OSR][11].
