There is a lot of creative output on the internet. This page collects some of that work, mostly because I was unhappy with the original presentation of things, or because I wanted to test or try something out.

* The original crowd sourced hex maps: [The Hexenbracken][1], [The Kraal][2], [The Colossal Wastes of Zhaar][3].
* Since those first maps we've made some more. Jacob Hurst organized making the crazy space map [Synthexia][12]. Josh Macy started this unnamed [Fallout themed hexcrawl][15]. (There is even [the Barbarian Prince][16] in hex map form.) I used HexKit to make what would become [The Lavender Marshes][14]. Gus drew an amazing map during a game with Luka Rejak, now called the [Gongburg Solitudes][17]. Another classic map from Gus is [Partol Sector Omega][18], which is "Githyanki Fantasy Fucking Veitnam".
* [The He-Man Show Bible][4] by Michael Halperin.
* [My 'beta' rules for OD&D Psionics][5]
* The infamous and notorious [PHILOTOMYâ€™S Dungeons and Dragons Musings][6] by Jason Cone.
* [Adam Taylor][7] giant list of spells for both [wizards][8] and [clerics][9], that you can filter by school and level. It's fantastic.
* [Zak Smith][10] on [Storygames and the OSR][11].
* [Madlib Dungeons][13] can be used to make a blob of text more exciting.
