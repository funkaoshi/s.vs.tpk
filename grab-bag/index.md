There is a lot of creative output on the internet. This page collects some of that work, mostly because I was unhappy with the original presentation of things, or because I wanted to test or try something out.

* The original crowd sourced hex maps: [The Hexenbracken][1], [The Kraal][2], [The Colossal Wastes of Zhaar][3].
* Since those first maps we've made some more. 
    * Jacob Hurst organized making the crazy space map [Synthexia][12]. 
    * Josh Macy started this unnamed [Fallout themed hexcrawl][15].
    * There is [the Barbarian Prince][16] in hex map form. (My friends and I used the same map for [one of D&D campaigns][19].) 
    * I used HexKit to make what would become [The Lavender Marshes][14]. 
    * Gus drew an amazing map during a game with Luka Rejak, now called the [Gongburg Solitudes][17]. 
    * Another classic map from Gus is [Partol Sector Omega][18], which is "Githyanki Fantasy Fucking Veitnam".
    * Jez has been trying to finsh [Kaltval][20] for ages.
    * I helped the mysterious mista tipsta and his friends turn their own attempt at a crowd sourced hexcrawl into a web page: [The Scorched Coast][21]
* [The He-Man Show Bible][4] by Michael Halperin.
* [My 'beta' rules for OD&D Psionics][5]
* The infamous and notorious [PHILOTOMYâ€™S Dungeons and Dragons Musings][6] by Jason Cone.
* [Adam Taylor][7] giant list of spells for both [wizards][8] and [clerics][9], that you can filter by school and level. It's fantastic.
* [Madlib Dungeons][13] can be used to make a blob of text more exciting.
