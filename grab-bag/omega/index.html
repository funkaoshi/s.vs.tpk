<h1>Astral Marines - Partol Sector Omega</h1>

<div id="introduction" class="write-up">
    <p>Patrol Sector Omega has its intrusions and enemy action, but it's not hot.  The Firebase is just precautionary, and it's close enough to the LZ that resupply will never be a problem.  The  moss beds are splendid at sunset and the Lotus Eaters nearby are pacified.  Just play some volleyball and relax.  The same can't be said to the North - the glass Pyramids and Stilt Village are shown as friendly on the recon slides, but then what shot down a cutter that way a few cycles back?  Something's brewing and the invaders can be behind every slime mold, invisible in spider holes beneath the moss or infiltrating the pacified villages, concealed by their crudely potent magics.</p>

                Here a hollow is marked by graffiti all around its lip. Bellumphage scrawl, Marine shorthand, Stiltrunes. ("This hole LIES!" they say.) The hollow speaks the coordinates of another hex. "That's where Zazziato is," it says. "He ate the Godhood Bomb and grants wishes now." The coordinates are reliable - though the hollow gives different coordinates every dawn-cycle breeze.

                Here in the forest there is a quiet shrine where the Hive Mothers come to lament their fallen brood, lost in the endless skirmishes with the prime material bandits. Each cell contains a memory from the childhood of one fallen Hive Grunt. If the brass catches wind of the shrine, they'll try to harness the unbearable memories for the construction of third degree grief ordinance. Any attempt to so harvest memories for military purposes will spawn a vengeful spirit hive.

                Among the tendrils and shoots of the deep forest is a series of dugusts carved through dense fungal blooms.  It is home to a group of guerilla fighters in contact with and supplied by the 812th Slave Battalion of the Bellumphagic Heirarchy of Thought.  These fighters are well trained, and supplied with advanced weapons, including state of the art shoulder mounted anti-air blood siprochet senders and a limited number of PASSE's (Penetrative Adaptive Seeking Super Egos) for the destruction and/or posession of armed units or titanic warbeasts.  The guerillas are fervent devotees of the Red Dream and currently have suborned the STILIT VILLAGE into providing intelligence and supplies.

The salientian lump of warty flesh is pus yellow where it's body is not covered in a thick armor of caked ash.  The god thing is not aggressive, though certainly capable of harm, and will trade cryptic prophecies, blessings for the ashes of valuables or friends burnt within its site.  It can restore life, but does not like to do so.

                "All of my sins have locked me in hell", reads a simple pedestal in the most unusual of places, surrounded by the bones of lesser creatures in the thousands. Pitted and scoured by the relentless howling winds a basin atop the pillar still holds the writhing liquid smoke - bound by ritual. "Plead again for rich rewards", it whispers "They shall be yours".  Above a wave of lost memories crawls down the slope like a glacier, holding the dreams of ages past, a blinding beacon in contrast to the black and broken stone surrounding.

                <a href='#0303' class='city-link'>SOUL SMOKER</a>. A polyphonic chorus of pained screams rise from the maw of a twin volcanic orchestra pits. The song hits the surface of the sands in a kind of tremelo, like a sickly rise and fall of the tides, shifting between discord and harmony,  never resting long enough for the listener to find comfort.  The closer one gets to the smoking pits, the more maddeningly discomforting the song becomes, causing hallucinations that will uniformly take one on a bad trip. Surrounding the bases of the vents is a twisted wreath of wrecked sand vessels. Steam fissures, burning boulders, rockslides, ash plumes, and sudden lava storms make climbing the vents hazardous and ash slyphs, nightmare goats, charcoal wisps, and steam mockers are all potential risks in the area.  Beneath the maw is a city of caverns and brass, once hom to invading elemental gods. The city  maintains their ancient and twisted society of enslaving and torturing all life it and its firey minions can manage to capture or breed.  Captives subject ot strange tortures of flame and ash until they sing their delirious songs of pain, coming together to form the voices of the dreadful, ethereal choir.

                This land exists beneath the ominous shadow of the <a href='#0303' class='city-link'>SOUL SMOKER</a>, and it's curse taints all who dwell here. Here,  the song of pain is distant, yet ever present.  A thousand tiny voices quietly hum the same song,  but all in different keys. Sometimes, the souls of those who die in the maw manage to escape.  They live here now,  missing much of themselves but not wishing not to find what has been lost in favor of quiet peace of their cramped stone villages. Once in a while, a soul will escape from the maw that was meant to burn too brightly to find rest, lighting up the sky, an electric brush stroke.

Frequent Skywhale falls have made the area rich with neutriants, and support entire empires of scavenging half-intelligent multiarmed apes, who feud and bicker from thier bone fortresses seeming unaware that they are stalked by at least two prides of fat sleek intellect devourers.

                The River turns East into another patrol sector.  Peaceful and broad there is the illusion of bucolic ease, but at night the Eastern horizon roils with withc light and sparkles with the tracers and bolts of arcane bombardment.  More dangerous are the floating mines laid here or launch on woody fungal rafts by the nearby guerillas <a class='hex-link' href='#0309'>0309</a>.  The mines are indescrimnate and powerful, making travel East a nussiance.  They are also cunningly constructed to look like the work of the bugs in <a href='#0207' class='city-link'>STILT VILLAGE</a> and are part of the Guerilla plan to either provoke a massacre or draw powerful units to the area that they can ambush.

                Psychokinetic Antlions draw prey towards them with strange dreams and malignant visions. What you most desire is at the centre of the sand-trap, what you most fear is one step behind. Down into the sand where they devour you feet-first. They save the brain for last. 
Antlion size defines the extent and power of their psychic projections.
The largest in the centre of the hex is 4 storeys deep and holds the others under its psychic sway. 
If you defeat it, they may be grateful.

                This great expanse of spiral sands is about as inhospitable a place as one could find, yet it teems with life and activity.  Skywhales slowly hover over this land,  feeding themselves with the sun through solar skin.  Their massive bodies cast shadows that tortoises the size of cities occupy, forming a strange type of symbiotic relationship.  In turn,  other forms of life grow up around these creatures to form their own ecologies. This expanse is also home to a myriad of astral pirates,  trade caravans, sandcrawler junkers, grub-riding nomads, and doomed pilgrims on their foolish voyage to hurl themselves into <a href='#0303' class='city-link'>SOUL SMOKER</a>.

                The spiral sands here churn slowly, unearthing from time to time precious repositories of mutagenic psyche-spice. This spice unleashes powerful psionic powers for 24 hours accompanied with wild hallucinations. Struggles to control the strange resource have left the area laden with corrosive bio-mines, and the ruins of small barb-wired outposts are occasionally disgorged by the desert more or less intact. The psyche-spice also attracts bands of intellect devourers that are addicted to the intellects of those tripping on spice.

The steep, oddly-shaped crags of this hex almost seem to act as magnets for the astral storms that rock the area more often than not. Mysterious monasteries are said to blink in and out of existence at certain intervals, though few travel here to learn their secrets. Fear of the infamous Storm Riders prevents visitors.

Within the sorcerers in thier pointed hats and heavy wool robes sing their cadre songs as they carve store rooms by magic, build ever more stable rifts to thier home plane, plunder astral riches and plan ambushes of supply convoys.

                Strangely shaped helical speleothems in the gravitic caves act as naturally occurring Antipathy Vortices. Negative thoughts and feelings are whisked away, only to be expelled en masse if the delicate balance of the area is disrupted.
Those travelling through the area must guard against Hatequakes and Fearbursts. Those who live in the area may be willing to act as guides, though they may abandon dangerous clients who make too much emotional noise.

                A silver bunker, hidden amongst the crags, containing many psionic soldiers sealed in during the Psychic Wars.  The bunker has two floors:  The top floor is occupied by the manifested Ids, Egos and Superegos of the soldiers who have each formed their own faction.  The bottom floor contains all of the soldiers in preservation tanks, their faces now pale and with a look of permanent horror.  Approaching the bunker, psychic anomalies can be observed.  Inside, the chaos gets much, much worse...

                An Astral Liner containing supplies and personnel crashed and partially sank into the great lake of primordial slime that permeates much of this hex. Her stern rests abutting a nearby crag, allowing precarious entry into the ship that now exists more or less as a leaning tower. You haven't been cleared to know what exactly the Liner carried or what the cause of the crash was. Common rumor has it that it was enemy sabotage, but more worrisome explanations also abound, ranging from monster worms to the siren songs of ghostly slime goddesses.

                The Cliffs of Contemplation: For an enormous nontime, "forward" and "backward" from the Omphalos Moment, the Cliffs of Contemplation have drawn those who have done with striving and seek instead to trace their thoughts through and endless moment or drive out that last illusion: the self. Slabs and precipices project over gulfs into which the light falls slowly, and on many of these crag spurs a single figure sits or kneels to perches, a panoply of intelligent races from across the planes. Many of them would have important information if hey could be roused from their contemplation. It is rumored that within a particular cave, a clear spring unleashes the Water of Clear Forgetting. Anyone who could find this could command much form the Contemplators.

                The call came in over the silver wires just after false dawn three cycles ago, a Cutter out of Airbase Golf was heading in to LZ Delta with a full load of troops and supplies.  The pilots barely had time to call in the groundfire, shocked to be under a sustained barrage in this pacified sector. On examination the troops and pilots are dead or missing, the dead reduced to flabby sacks filled with bloody slurry by the state of the art spirochetes sent from some kind of shoulder-launched man portable-loci.  Cargo remains largely unlooted, but consists entirely of crates of rattling bound demons designed for long range artillery summonings.

                A crew of time-traveling actors have arrived to film a movie of the conflict. The actors all represent what future people will see as crude caricatures of the conflict, yet they have become mistakenly enmeshed in it. Fairly clueless about actual history, the actors aren't exactly certain about the outcome of the war.

Searching might turn up ruined military gear from any number of ehternaut races and a strange profusion of slick black bones, hard to grasp firmly and seemingly still buzzing with mysterious vitality. There are many places to camp or hole up in this area, and some are occupied already.

The soldiers are on edge, for they fear being admonished for wasting ammunition and killing off potential slaves and sacrifices to the Great Auntie Vlaakith. The officers have ordered the grunts to terminate anybody who might rat them out with extreme prejudice.

                Living snails of all sizes crawl over hillocks of their ancestors shells.  Slowly they nibble back the moss, or follow thier mollusc dreams and instincts with ponderous inevitability. Men and other things from other worlds and times find the shells desirable and often skulk here to thieve and collect, making this a reliable place to hunt the enemy.

                The remains of a shattered criminal cartel lair here in the jungle, their astral opiate manufacturing facilities hidden beneath the cover of fungal canopy. Although the cartel is made mostly of local toughs and gangsters, the cartel was once sponsored by a proxy government favorable to a foreign regime of psychic worm people deep within the Astral Plane. Though not exactly interlopers, they were in the way of Yanki expansion here and the war on extraplanar perversion, so they were crushed. Still, a few of the worms remain leading this husk of the cartel that has survived the purge that happened at the start of the war.

                The tendril forest and the moss bed exist at different physical levels. This is hardly noticeable except in this area of maximum intermingling, where a constant sussurus reveals that the different ways the two terrains interact with wind, temperature, light, observation. All parties and creatures in this area are more likely to be surprised, and stealth chances are enhanced. However, reflections, echoes, and percetual ripples from beings that passed through at random removes in space and time also disturb the sense of any in this area, making saving throws necessary to gain the benefits of rest.

                Above the confluence is a graveyard of boats from across the planes. Whether these were wrecked elsewhere and in their long decay slipped through to this plane or were sucked through the psychic whirlpools spinning out from the ways is unknowable. But where the river slows and broadens it creeps through the bones of a thousand wrecks from a thousand worlds, from fragile pleasure craft made from chrysalid gossamer to blocks of floating stone once pulled through blood seas by sentient flukes that lived, dreamed, suffered, bred, and died in the harness.  No remains of any of the ships crews persist.

The mad autofac of a forgotten time burnt through space in cosmic perambulation that has left devastation and blight behind it. It's polydimensional casing cracked and folded by the astral emanations, still, upon its steps the excreta of meaning of the autofac bring creation into being. On the first level seventeen productive vents produce thirteen classes of production, acquisition and manipulation psychic automata. On the second level three administrative vents produce six classes of management, optimization and control automata. On the third level a garden grows profuse creative destruction synergy beetles. On the fourth shells burst into riot and profusion. On the fifth fifty-five outflow valves emit liquiescent executive direction automata of three colors. On the sixth a creative legislative automaton lumbers in mad circles excreting senescent nonsense. On the seventh stand three doors of red lips. On the eighth stands a collection of great and good products of the autofac autoage. There is no ninth. On the tenth is an icy phlegm, trapped within the two autocannibal heads of the autofac designers Amg and Abarth. On the eleventh a wall of steam hides seventeen astral projections of the ultimate order. On the twelth the great walls of creative autofactory are guarded by 144 consumptive consumer zombies of the final culture. On the thirteenth is the palace of autofac reason. The palace is empty.

                An anachronism and anomaly in the modern day, the walled (or shelled, rather) city of <a href='#0808' class='city-link'>GREAT SHELLS</a> represents the last remnant of an ancient empire of Snailpeople. Once citizens of a belligerent state, the people of Great Shells turned inward, looking to homegrown spirituality and innovations to keep their society growing. Secured both by the mobility and protection of their ancient shell fortress-vehicles, a class of priests led by their high matriarch have created a popular place for visitors and refugees alike. Despite the reputation for not going out of their shells, the Snailpeople are, or at least become, surprisingly cosmopolitan when newcomers arrive. Great Shells is said to be a placid paradise, although the snail hats commonly worn by stranger and native alike can be quite off-putting.

Eons ago, a mad githzerai exile stole many eggs and transplanted them here, leaving the place infested with dormant slaadi. Altered by their githzerai "father", these slaadi advocate a form of mystical anarchocommunism that focuses on freeing the unenlightened from their authoritarian tethers by freeing them from their "meatbag" bodies. The slaadi say, "inside of each humanoid, there is a slaadi just screaming to get out." Regardless of the truth or lack thereof in their beliefs, the slaadi remain a threat to river traffic and also spread out into nearby hexes, haranguing Lotus Eaters, Astral Marines, or King in Crimson acolytes alike.

Within gleam tiny jewel like globes, and points of starry light.  Those who submerge in the dark tarry substance that holds them never return.

                Here strode a god. Now a black lake of putrefaction, slowly merging with the reef of corruption [(0909)]. The waters thick and vicous but not yet the creeping anti-matter. Brought low by its own crustacean-like children. They built empires amid the bioluminescent organs of their creator. Filling every space they could find until they were all that flowed through its veins. It was here that it fell, crushing the very earth as it toppled bringing the cataclysm to its children. Those that survived are now twisted and hideous parasites wallowing in the icor. Starving and mad for that which they will never again touch, the divine. Somewhere in the depths of the god lake rests the final fragments of a once great being. Hidden by its spawn, all that remains, their god's eye.

                The caissons are not rolling here.  When <a href='#1003' class='city-link'>FIREBASE OMEGA</a> was younger, with a less jaded commander an artillery park was planned here on this deceptively placid looking azure moss bed.  The moss bed proved far deeper then expected and unable to support the weight of any significant number of demon engines.  The plan for a support position was abandoned, the artillery company withdrawn.  However,  a lack of resources prevented the recovery of three heavy demon engines, and they remain, mostly sunk in deep moss, requiring far more brawn and effort to remove then the current forces in the area feel like exerting to free.

                A trio of sinister shedu solicit disciples for their cult by drawning in clueless Lotus Eaters from the VILLAGE OF THE LOTUS EATERS to the east, though the shedu cult itself hides itself adeptly in the mossy hills of this hex. The shedu cult leaders appear to be beneficial by leading the Lotus Eaters to cast out other interlopers, but the wrath the Shedu inspire has become perverted in all the worst ways. Even greater greater, it's supposed to be the Astral Marines that determine how the Lotus Eaters think!

                <a href='#1106' class='city-link'>LOTUS EATER VILLAGE</a>. Pacified more by thier own addictions and placid nature the villagers don't seem to mind the nearby base, or the bands of Astral Marines that come here on the sly for cheap kicks.  The villagers are strangely tall and emaciated, and the village's ancient wooden houses run down in the way of picturesque rural poverty.  Drugs, companionship, booze and most of all the silver lotus of sweet anhillation can be had here for fairly cheap.  Despite thier languid appearence and squalid lives the villagers moil endlessly in their lotus paddies to feed thier addicition.

                A bed of nails sits alone in the middle of a bed of moss. Surrounding it, nailed to the sky which is very low in these regions, the living souls of warriors defeated in battle against the Psychic Warlords of the Lotus Manager.

                The stench, billowous clouds crawl across the landscape obscuring site and dampening sound but the rank odour is clearly rotting meat and the sound of battle resonates. The region is a pitted and ruined bowl-like depression with snaking trenches created by two mad wizards and their loathsome forces. Home to the Wizard of Gore aptly wearing red she uses necromantic arts to create fodder for the warmachine. Defending her territory from the Wizard of Wor clad in blue and master of vivisection with his stitchwork horde of insectoid like worluks and the thorwor scorpion like mockeries.

                Trapped deep in the moss is a giant out of space and time, a skeleton clad in silvery armor, it's house sized skull visiable beneath the pitted clear dome of a titanic bubble helmet.  Inside the great cave of the <a href='#1109' class='city-link'>DEAD GIANT</a>'s cranium crystals glitter and sparkle with dim inner life, and lines of arcane silver form a delicate web carrying impulses and coded information from it's home dimension through the void where the tissue of the Giant's brain has rotted away.
