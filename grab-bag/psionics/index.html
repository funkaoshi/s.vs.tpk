<p>Some rules for psionics inspired by the specialist class from Lamentations of the Flame Princess. Suitable for any &quot;old-school&quot; Dungeons and Dragons game. This is still a work in progress. If you have any feedback please get in touch.</p>

<h2 id="mindbenders">Mindbenders</h2>

<!--
Those who have mastered both the Will and the Way are called Mindbenders. Many people in Athas have latent psionic power, so called wild talents, but few are able to harness those powers into something more.
-->

<p>Mindbenders are the only characters in the game with access to psionic powers. They improve in their ability to use these powers as they gain levels. Characters begin the game with X &quot;points&quot; to allocate between the various psionic powers. They gain Y more points to allocate to these powers each time they gain a level. All skills begin with no points allocated and are unusable by the Mindbender until they spend a point to learn them. Each power has an <em>x</em> in 6 chance of succeeding, where <em>x</em> is the number of points a player as allocated to the power. (Clearly no skill can have more than a 6 in 6 chance of success.)</p>

<p>To use a power a player simply rolls a d6 and attempts to roll equal to or under the points allocated to the skill. The result of the die roll is called the <em>power roll</em> and is sometimes referred to in the power descriptions. Anytime a 1 is rolled that power is exhausted for the day. A Mindbender must rest for 8 hours to regain their exhausted powers.</p>

<p>In addition to the guaranteed success that comes with allocating 6 points to a power, there is one further benefit: when a 6 is rolled while attempting to use the power the Mindbender experiences a psychic surge. Each psionic power has a surge effect, that explains what happens in this case.</p>

<p>Mindbender&#39;s can expend 1d6 HP to use a power they have exhausted for the day with guaranteed success, or to succeed in any failed power roll. In both cases their <em>power roll</em> will be the amount of HP they lose. The character is knocked out if this reduces them to 0 or less HP: they will be completely catatonic for 1d6 days. </p>

<h2 id="wild-talents">Wild Talents</h2>

<p>If a character isn&#39;t playing a Mindbender, they still may have some latent psionic power. The player should roll under their Wisdom score to determine if their character has a wild psionic talent. If they succeed, the amount they succeed by determines their wild talent as follows:</p>

<p>If they fail the roll the character has no wild talent. Instead, the character gains a bonus to all saving throws when targeted by psionic power equal to the amount they failed by divided by two (round down).</p>

<p>For example, if a character has 14 Wisdom, and rolls a 9 when checking to see if they have a psionic power, they would gain the power Telekinetic Grasp. If on the other hand they rolled a 17, they would gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws against psionic powers.</p>

<p>A character may use their psionic power once per day. (<strong>Psionic Immunity</strong> and <strong>The Haitian</strong> are exceptions here: they are always active.)</p>

<h3 id="clairaudience">Clairaudience</h3>

<h3 id="clairvoyance">Clairvoyance</h3>

<h3 id="mind-control">Mind Control</h3>

<h3 id="mind-wipe">Mind Wipe</h3>

<h3 id="telekinesis">Telekinesis</h3>

<h3 id="telepathy">Telepathy</h3>

<p>The character can read the minds of any creature around them and can communicate thoughts to them. The character need not share a common language with any creature he is communicating with in order to be understood.</p>

<h3 id="precognition">Precognition</h3>

<p>The character sees their near future. They may re-roll one of their dice rolls with a bonus equal to their power roll. (This power may be used at any time during combat.)</p>

<p><strong>Surge - Beyond Time:</strong> The character exists beyond time and space, seeing all events unfold around them at once. Though they can never truly comprehend what they witness, they may re-roll any dice roll (theirs, another player&#39;s, or the DM&#39;s) with a +6 bonus.</p>

<h3 id="cell-adjustment">Cell Adjustment</h3>

Each round thereafter they may make a Save vs. Poison to attempt to regain control of their transformation. If they fail their body doubles in size and grotesqueness.</p>
