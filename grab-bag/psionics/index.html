          <h1>Psionics <small>beta</small></h1>

          <p>Psionicists begin the game with one psionic power and one mental hit point (MHP). Psionicists gain an additional MHP when they gain a level. When Psionicists gain an <em>even</em> level they may choose an additional psionic power or choose to gain an additional MHP. Psionicists recover all their MHP after a night of rest.</p>

          <p>Psionicists expend 1 MHP to use one of their psionic power. Most psionic powers can be augmented by expending additional MHP when they are used: augmenting a power with more psionic energy usually increases the powers range, duration, and effects.</p>

          <p>All psionic powers also have a surge effect. To trigger a power's surge effect a Psionicist must expend all their MHP, and this amount must be higher than 6. Most surge effects require a saving throw to avoid some sort of detriment that occurs after the power takes effect.</p>

          <p>A Psionicist can expend hit points to use their psionic powers as well: 1d6 HP can be converted to 1 MHP. The character is knocked out if this reduces them to 0 or less HP: they will be completely catatonic for 1d6 days.</p>

          <p>When the target of a psionic power is another Psionicist, they may choose to expend MHP equal to the MHP spent to use the power in order to ignore the effects of the power. Both Psionicists must make a Save vs. Magic or be dazed for 1 round.</p>

          <h2>Psionic Powers</h2>

          <p>All powers last 1 turn per MHP spent and have a range of 50’ per MHP spent where appropriate, unless otherwise noted.</p>

          <div class='power'>
              <p><strong>Telekinesis</strong> - The character moves and manipulates objects with their mind. They can move 50 lbs of weight per MHP spent. They may levitate themselves above the ground (up to 10') regardless of their weight. Any creatures targeted by this power may make a Save vs. Paralysis to avoid being moved.</p>
              <p><strong>Surge: Disintegrate</strong> - The character rips apart their opponents with their mind: 1 HD per MHP monsters are instantly killed. Each target may make a Save vs. Death to instead take half their hit dice in damage <s></s> e.g. A 4 HD creature will take 2d6 damage if they make their saving throw. The character must make a Save vs. Magic or be knocked out after using the power.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class='power'>
              <p><strong>Clairvoyance</strong> - The character can see through walls and over long distance. They must be able to see the location they want to divine or know of its existence. </p>
              <p><strong>Surge: Sight Beyond Sight</strong> - The character can both see and hear any location in the world. The character must make a Save vs. Magic or be blinded for 1d6 days.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='power'>
              <p><strong>Telepathy</strong> - The character can read the minds of any creature around them and can communicate thoughts to them. If the character spends additional MHP they may also attempt to mentally control the creature. The creature may make a Save vs. Magic to avoid the mind control. By spending additional MHP the character may target more creatures at once: the number of creatures effected in Hit Dice equals the amount of MHP spent. </p>
              <p><strong>Surge: Mind Wipe</strong> - The character leaves any creatures targeted by their telepathy completely catatonic. The number of creatures effected in Hit Dice equals the amount of MHP spent. Each creature gets a Save vs. Magic with a +1 penalty for each MHP spent. The character must make a Save vs. Magic or be knocked out after using the power.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class='power'>
              <p><strong>Precognition</strong> - The character sees their near future. They may re-roll one of their dice rolls with a +1 bonus for each MHP spent. (This power may be used at any time during combat.)</p>
              <p><strong>Surge: Beyond Time</strong> - The character exists beyond time and space, seeing all events unfold around them at once. Though they can never truly comprehend what they witness, they may re-roll any dice roll (theirs, another player's, or the DM's) with a +1 bonus or penalty for each MHP spent.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class='power'>
              <p><strong>Cell Adjustment</strong> - The character is attuned to the minute processes of their body. They may recover 1d6 HP for every two MHP spent (round down).</p>
              <p><strong>Surge: Psychometabolism</strong> - The character has perfect understanding and control of their body. They recover all their HP. They may polymorph their body into any shape and size. Creatures trying to hit the character's new form take a -1 penalty for each MHP spent. The character must make a Save vs. Poison: if they fail the saving throw they lose control over their transformation, mutating into a grotesque growing pile of human flesh and muscle. Each round thereafter they may make a Save vs. Poison to attempt to regain control of their transformation. If they fail their body doubles in size and grotesqueness.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h2>Wild Talents</h2>

          <p>Player's should roll under their Wisdom score to determine if their character has a wild psionic talent. If they fail the roll the character has no wild talent; if they succeed, the amount they succeed by determines their wild talent as follows: </p>

          <table>
          <tr><td>0 </td><td></td></tr>
          <tr><td>1 </td><td><strong>Far Hearing</strong> - For one turn the character hears all sounds within 50’ as if they were being whispered directly into their ear. The character may choose what sounds to focus on.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2 </td><td><strong>Far Seeing</strong> - For one turn the character may view a scene up to 50' away as if they were right there. They may see through walls and other obstacles, but not through lead.</td></tr>

          <tr><td>6 </td><td><strong>Spark</strong> - The character may ignite any flammable object within 50' of them. (The “heat” this power generates is no greater than that of a candle.)</td></tr>

          <tr><td>8 </td><td><strong>Levitate</strong> - For 1 turn, the character can float above the ground (up to 10').</td></tr>

(This increases to 1d6 at level 3, 1d8 at level 6, 1d10 at level 9 and 1d12 at level 12.) The character may make a Save vs. Poison to cure themselves of any non-magical disease.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>11</td><td></td></tr>
          <tr><td>12</td><td></td></tr>
          <tr><td>13</td><td><strong>Psychic Distress</strong>: All sentient characters, friend or foe, within 25’ of the character are immobilized for 1 turn.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>14</td><td><strong>Minor Mind Control</strong>: For 1 turn, the character may manipulate the target into doing whatever the character wants. The target will have no memory of any events that transpire while under this mind control. The target my make a Save vs. Magic to resist the mind control.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>15</td><td><strong>Minor Precognition</strong>: The character may re-roll any saving throw.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>16</td><td><strong>Psionic Immunity</strong>: The character can not be the target of any psionic power.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>17</td><td><strong>The Haitian</strong>: no character within 10' of the character, friend or foe, may use their psionic powers. The character also gains <strong>Psionic Immunity</strong>.</td></tr>
          </table>
          
          <p>A character may use their psionic power once per day. (<strong>Psionic Immunity</strong> and <strong>The Haitian</strong> are exceptions here: they are always active.)</p>
