			<h4>4th lvl Abjuration</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>1 minute</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>30 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>One target creature</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>See below </dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell can send an other-worldly creature back to its own Realm. The spell has no power over demigods, or beings of greater power, but their servants or minions can be <em class="spellname">Abjured</em>.</p>

					<p>The spell requires that the priest strongly present his holy symbol, and also some material inimical to the creature.</p>

					<p>The spell does not usually allow a Save, but any <em>Magic Resistance</em> of the subject must be overcome, or the spell fails. In any case, if the spell is successful, the creature is instantly hurled back to its own Realm (usually to its home there, if it has one).</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Abjure</em> works upon creatures that are physically present, but also can serve to drive a possessing spirit from an unwilling host. In this case the <em class="spellname">Abjure</em> can only force it to vacate the host; it will remain in the area and may be able to possess another.</p>

					<p>If the attempt fails, the priest must gain a level before another attempt can be made on that particular creature.</p>

			<h3>Aid</h3>
			<h4>2nd lvl Evocation</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">

				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>One recipient</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>5 minutes + 1 minute / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>

				<dd>
					<p>The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a <em class="spell priest">Bless</em> (+1 to To Hit rolls and Saves) and 1d8 additional HP for the duration of the spell.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Aid</em> enables the recipient to have more HP than his normal total. The bonus HP are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Aid</em> is not cumulative with the effects of <em class="spell priest">Bless</em>, <em class="spell priest">Chant</em>, <em class="spell priest">Exaltation</em>, <em class="spell priest">Prayer</em>, <em class="spell priest">Sanctify</em> and the like - the most powerful spell will take precedence.</p>

			<h3>Animal Growth</h3>
			<h4>5th lvl Alteration (Reversible)</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>8</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>100 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>Up to 8 animals in a 20 ft. radius.</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>2 rounds / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>When this spell is cast, the priest causes up to eight animals within the AOE to grow to twice their normal size. It can affect animals of any sort, including Giant and Dire creatures.</p>

					<p>The effects of this growth are doubled HD (with an increase in THACO), doubled HP, and doubled damage in combat. Movement, AC and special attacks are not affected.</p>

					<p>The reverse, <em class="spellname">Dwindle Animal</em>, reduces animal size by one-half, and likewise reduces HD, HP, and attack damage.</p>

			<h3>Animate Rock</h3>
			<h4>7th lvl Alteration</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>1 round</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>120 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>2 cu. ft. / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>3 rounds / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p><em class="spellname">Animate Rock</em> awakens a great Elemental spirit within any stone object of up to the indicated size. The <em class="spellname">Animated Rock</em> must be a single separate object, not a part of a larger boulder or the like.</p>

					<p>It follows the desire of the caster - attacking, breaking objects, blocking - while the magic lasts. It has no intelligence or volition of its own, but it follows instructions exactly as spoken. Only one set of orders can be given to the <em class="spellname">Animated Rock</em>, and the directions must be brief, about a dozen words or so.</p>

					<p>While the exact details of the animated rock are decided by the DM, its AC is no worse than 4, and it has 1d4 HP per cubic foot of volume. It uses the THACO of the caster. The maximum damage it can inflict is 1d2 points / caster level (or 1 pt of <em>Structural Damage</em> / caster level). Movement for an <em class="spellname">Animated Rock</em> is 30 ft. / round.</p>

					<p>Rock generally weighs from 100 to 300 lbs per cubic foot.</p>

			<h3>Astral Travel</h3>
			<h4>7th lvl Alteration <span class="spelltype" data-filttype="Astral">Astral</span></h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>10 minutes</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>Touch</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>Caster and up to six other creatures</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>By means of <em class="spellname">Astral Travel</em>, a priest can project souls into the Astral Realm, leaving their physical bodies and material possessions behind and inert within the Mortal Realm. The soul-forms can then travel to the home Realm of the caster's patron deity, and there form new temporary bodies. Only enchanted items can be brought with them on this journey; mundane objects will have no equivalent elsewhere.</p>

					<p>The priest can project the Astral forms of up to six other creatures with him by means of <em class="spellname">Astral Travel</em>, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the caster. These fellow travellers are dependent upon the caster for guidance, and can be stranded or lost in the Astral Realm. Otherwise they will go with him to his destination.</p>

					<p>During this journey, which might take an indeterminate period of time, the travellers' soul-forms are tethered to their material bodies by silvery cords. If a cord is broken, the affected person is killed, Astrally and materially; however, very few forces can sever a cord. If an Astral form is slain while travelling, the cord simply returns to the original body, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. When a second body is formed in a God's Realm, the silvery cord becomes part of it, until the Astral Realm is entered again.</p>

					<p>While elsewhere, the travellers' bodies are vulnerable. If they are slain while their soul-forms are Astrally travelling, the lost souls go to an unknown fate. If the travellers have already formed new bodies in another Realm, they become forfeit to the powers there, and are usually never seen again.</p>

					<p>In order to regain their bodies, the caster must use <em class="spellname">Astral Travel</em> once more for the return trip.</p>

			<h3>Atonement</h3>
			<h4>5th lvl Abjuration</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>1 hour</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>Touch</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>1 person</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>Permanent</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell is used to remove the burden of sinful deeds and magical alignment changes from the subject.</p>

					<p>The person seeking <em class="spellname">Atonement</em> must either be truly repentant, or else not have been in command of his own will when the sinful acts were committed. The DM will judge this spell in this regard, noting any past instances of its use.</p>

					<p>Some misdeeds are too extreme and cannot be <em class="spellname">Atoned</em> for without a casting of <em class="spell priest">Quest</em>.</p>

					<p>A character who refuses to accept an <em class="spellname">Atonement</em> is automatically considered to have committed a willful misdeed.</p>
				</dd>

			<h3>Augury</h3>
			<h4>2nd lvl Divination</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>20 minutes</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>0</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The priest casting <em class="spellname">Augury</em> seeks to divine whether a given action in the immediate future (within one-half hour) will benefit or harm the party. The specifics of the casting depends on the caster's faith; reading the clouds or a creature's entrails, for example.</p>

					<p>There is a base 70% chance (+1% / caster level) of recieving a direct answer of 'good fortune' or 'bad'. This chance may be modified by local circumstances at the DM's discretion. Otherwise the answer will arrive in the form of a cryptic verse, puzzle or pronouncement.</p>

					<p>Casting several <em class="spellname">Auguries</em> about the same action in quick succession will receive identical answers, regardless of the dice rolls.</p>

			<h3>Aura Of Bravery</h3>
			<h4>5th lvl Enchantment (Reversible)</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>1 round</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>30 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>50 ft. radius around recipient</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>5 rounds / caster level; see below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell is centred upon one individual. In its normal form, it suffuses the recipient with holy energies, such that they radiate fearless stout-heartedness.</p>

					<p>The recipient becomes immune to all fear-based effects for the duration, and his allies within the AOE gain a +3 to Saves vs. the same. All affected also gain a +1 To Hit and +1 damage caused.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Aura Of Bravery</em> is not cumulative with <em class="spell priest">Cloak Of Bravery</em>. It is cumulative with bonuses from <em class="spell priest">Bless</em>, <em class="spell priest">Aid</em> and the like.</p>

					<p>The reverse, <em class="spellname">Terrible Aura</em>, causes the recipient to radiate a freezing, breath-stopping terror which does not affect them, but forces all enemies who come within the AOE to Save or flee in panic for 2d6 rounds.</p>

					<p>Once a Save has been made, a victim can remain within the AOE, but will still experience a terrifying influence. An enemy who fails a Save must re-roll if they later re-enter the AOE while the spell remains.</p>

			<h3>Awaken Tree-Spirit</h3>
			<h4>6th lvl Enchantment</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>10 minutes</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>Touch; see below</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>1 tree</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>1 day / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell enables the caster to give animation to the spirit of a healthy tree, allowing it to serve as a protector. The tree upon which the spell is cast must be within a place sacred to the caster, or within 300 ft. of something that the caster wishes to guard or protect.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Awaken Tree-Spirit</em> can be cast upon a healthy tree of small, medium, or large size, according to desire and what is available.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Spirit</em> will awaken immediately, but not take action unless what it guards is threatened; it will remain immobile and will usually be mistaken for a mundane tree. The <em class="spellname">Tree-Spirit</em> will move and act to protect the sacred ground or whatever was originally designated by the caster, attacking foes as needed. It will not pursue enemies or attack those who do not threaten what it guards.</p>

					</dl>

					<p>A tree enchanted by this spell radiates a magical aura, and can be returned to normal by a successful casting of <em class="spell priest">Break Sorcery</em>, or by the desire of the caster who enchanted it. If dispelled, the tree takes root immediately. If released by the caster, it tries to return to its original location before taking root.</p>

					<p>Damage to the tree can be healed with a <em class="spell priest">Plant Growth</em> spell, which restores 3d4 HP damage, but does not increase the size or HP of the <em class="spellname">Awakened Tree-Spirit</em>.</p>

					<p>While an <em class="spellname">Awaken Tree-Spirit</em> spell cast by a particular caster is in effect, he cannot cast another such spell.</p>

					<p>When a priest casts <em class="spellname">Bark-Skin</em> upon a creature, its skin cracks and darkens, and becomes as tough as bark. This increases its base AC as follows:</p>

					<p>At the culmination of this spell, the priest utters a deafening cry which draws the attentions of all hostile creatures within the AOE, except those that are deaf, mindless or undead.</p>

					<p>1d4 HD of these creatures / caster level are stunned for 1d3 rounds, losing 2 AC and suffering a -3 penalty To Hit. Creatures with the lowest HD are affected first.</p>

					<p>Also, all enemies in the area must Save, or thereafter attempt to physically attack the priest, foregoing any other actions. Their desire to hunt down the priest remains for a further 6 rounds.</p>

					<p>At the same time, all friendly creatures within the range of the spell receive the benefit of a <em class="spell priest">Bless</em> spell (+1 to To Hit rolls and Saves). Friendly creatures also receive a +1 to morale rolls as long as the priest remains alive.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Battle Cry</em> is not cumulative with the effects of <em class="spell priest">Bless</em>, <em class="spell priest">Aid</em>, <em class="spell priest">Chant</em>, <em class="spell priest">Prayer</em>, <em class="spell priest">Exaltation</em>, <em class="spell priest">Sanctify</em> and the like - the most powerful spell will take precedence.</p>

				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>90 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>30 ft. radius</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>8 hours; see below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>Negates</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell brings forth a looming shadowy shape; a bestial spirit that is typically used to guard some area against intrusion.</p>

					<p>Any creature approaching the space being guarded may be able to detect its presence before entering; this chance of detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twilight conditions, and 0% in darkness.</p>

					<p>Any creature entering the guarded area may be affected by the <em class="spellname">Beast</em>. They must roll a successful Save or be struck and stand paralysed for one round / caster level, or until freed by the caster.</p>

					<p>A successful Save indicates that the <em class="spellname">Beast Guardian</em> missed the creature, and the spell remains in place to attack other beings. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck by the spirit, the paralysis takes effect and the <em class="spellname">Beast</em> dissipates.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This magic allows the caster to share an animal's perception. It may be cast only on animals (normal, giant or Dire) within range, and the target is allowed a Save to avoid the effect.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Beast Rider</em> does not give control over the animal's movements or actions (another spell may be necessary), but continues for the full duration, even if the animal later moves out of the initial targeting range.</p>

					<p>The caster receives full sensory impressions from the target, and can swap back and forth at will between the beast's senses and his own for the duration.</p>

			<h3>Beast's Sense</h3>
			<h4>1st lvl Alteration</h4>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>Negates</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell confers upon the recipient a single sensory ability of an animal.</p>

					<p>Only mundane animal senses may be conferred with this magic, including a cat's <em>Night Vision</em>, a dog's sense of smell, and so on. The new sense can sometimes be disorientating - each time it is used a Save vs. Int must be made to interpret the sensory input. After three successful Saves the sense is completely integrated and no more rolls must be made.</p>

					<p>In general, the end result is a &plusmn;3 bonus to all appropriate rolls for Perception, including Non-Weapon Proficiencies, e.g. <em>Tracking</em>.</p>

					<p>This spell may be used multiple times upon a given person, but each new sense after the first imposes a -2 penalty to Int for the purposes of understanding the senses.</p>

					<p>This spell creates a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around a central point, creating an immobile barrier.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Blades</em> form a plane at any angle, of any dimensions, to a maximum of 150 ft. square.</p>

					<p>Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a Save. If this is successful, the creature can leap backwards; the <em class="spellname">Blades</em> are avoided and no damage is suffered. Inanimate objects caught within must Save or be destroyed; constructions will sustain 8 pts of <em>Structural Damage</em> each round.</p>

			<h4>1st lvl Evocation (Reversible)</h4>

				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>5 rounds + 1 round / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A <em class="spellname">Blessing</em> confers the favour of the caster's deity upon his allies within the AOE. They will feel the effects immediately, manifesting as appropriate for the god in question.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Bless</em> affects only creatures not already engaged in melee combat. It grants a +1 bonus To Hit rolls and to Saves.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Bless</em> is not cumulative with the effects of <em class="spell priest">Aid</em>, <em class="spell priest">Chant</em>, <em class="spell priest">Prayer</em>, <em class="spell priest">Exaltation</em>, <em class="spell priest">Sanctify</em> and the like - the most powerful spell will take precedence.</p>

					<p>Alternatively, a single weapon can be <em class="spellname">Blessed</em> (for example, a crossbow bolt for use against a demon). <em class="spellname">Blessed</em> weapons are usually able to harm undead and other foes where a mundane item cannot. The effect lasts for a single use, or until the spell duration ends.</p>

					<p>When cast by priests of Mastiphal of 10th level or higher, this spell can be used to create Holy Waters of Mastiphal.</p>

					<p>The reverse spell is a minor <em class="spellname">Curse</em> that lowers enemy morale and To Hit rolls by -1. There is an equivalent effect which can be placed upon a weapon to harm other-worldly enemy beings; it may manifest as a buzzing black radiance, leaking blood, or a similar unsettling aura.</p>

					<p>This spell causes one tree seed or seedling / caster level to be especially blessed. When the seeds are planted in the ground, growth will begin at an astonishing rate.</p>

					<p>In just ten minutes the plants will shoot up to a beginning height of 2 ft., + 1 ft. / caster level.

					<p>When this spell is cast, it has a chance to negate magic within its AOE.</p>

					<p>The caster can always <em class="spellname">Break</em> his own magics; otherwise, the chance is a base of 11 or higher on 2d10, &plusmn; difference in caster levels. Any roll of 2 is an automatic failure and 20 a success. Each effect in the spell's area is checked individually to determine if it is dispelled.</p>

					<p>On a success:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>It removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) placed on creatures, objects and the AOE.</li>
						<li>It disrupts the casting or use of these in the AOE at the instant the <em class="spellname">Break Sorcery</em> is cast.</li>

					<p>This spell summons an <em>Aerial Servant</em>, a Duke of the Court of Air, to find and bring back an object or creature described to it by the priest. Once the command is given, the <em>Servant</em> will rush away to find its quarry.</p>

					<p>When the <em>Servant</em> arrives at its target, it will immediately try to grasp the creature or object. Creatures, or items held by a creature, can resist, but the <em>Aerial Servant</em> <em>Surprises</em> at -3, unless the victim has detected it in some manner. Each round of combat, the <em>Aerial Servant</em> makes a Grappling attack. When a hit is scored, the <em>Servant</em> has grabbed the item or creature it was sent for.</p>

					<p>The <em>Aerial Servant</em> will then fly back to its master with the target. A grabbed creature can try to struggle free, rolling Str vs. the <em>Servant</em>'s Str of 20. The attempt can be made once per round, but at a -1 penalty to the victim's Str each round after the first. If the target does break free, they will drop out of the Servant's grasp, but it will immediately try to grab them again.</p>

					<p>Once the quarry has been dropped at the feet of the caster (even if he no longer lives), the <em>Servant</em> will leave whence it came.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This magic only functions outdoors, beneath an open sky. It allows the priest to summon bolts of lightning to strike where he desires. If a storm is in the sky, the spell is more powerful.</p>

					<p>During the Casting Time, the priest's divine powers will begin to darken the air and build the storm. All nearby will feel the atmosphere become charged and full of potential; tiny sparks may begin to crackle from metal objects within the spell's range.</p>

					<p>Once the spell is prepared, the caster can call down one bolt every ten rounds. The caster need not call a bolt of lightning immediately - other actions, including spellcasting, can be performed; however, the caster must maintain Minimal <em>Concentration</em> for a full round each time a bolt is called. The lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke, and injures every creature within 10 ft. of the point of impact.</p>

					<p>Without an existing storm, each bolt causes 2d4 points of damage, + 1d4 / caster level. If a storm is available, each bolt causes 2d6 points of damage, + 1d6 / caster level. In either case a successful save halves damage taken. Any target standing in water or carrying a great deal of metal has a penalty of -3 to their Save.</p>

					<p>An existing storm can be of any kind - a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado, including a whirlwind formed by an Air Elemental.</p>

					<p>Using this spell, three to five priests of the same faith group their abilities so that one of them casts spells and (where applicable) uses granted powers at an enhanced level.</p>

					<p>When this spell is employed, the priest calls upon one or more powerful servitors from his deity's home Realm and requires of them some duty or quest.</p>

					<p>Unlike <em class="spellname">Gate Between Realms</em>, the call of this spell cannot be refused by the chosen subject. The call is accompanied by a promise of recompense or reward, which much be reasonable and balanced.</p>

					<p>The DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest, according to its nature.</p>

					<p>If the situation is left unbalanced (for example, the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for), then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's surviving kith and kin. Agreeing to a future <em class="spellname">Service</em> or release in the event of catastrophic failure are common caster pledges in securing <em class="spellname">Divine Service</em>.</p>

					<p>Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there give over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own Realm.</p>

					<p>Failure to deliver the reward to the letter results in the priest being subject to <em class="spellname">Divine Service</em> by the subject creature, or by its master, at the very least. At worst, the creature can attack the reneging priest without fear of any of his spells affecting it, for the priest's failure to live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's spell powers.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the creature touched to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even if under the influence of impeding magic (such as <em class="spell">Web</em>, <em class="spell">Tzunk's Iron Shoes</em>, paralysis and <em>hold</em> effects), while under water, or while buffeted by high winds.</p>

					<p>Under water, the individual moves at normal surface speed and inflicts full damage, provided that weapons are wielded in the hand rather than hurled.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>Casting this spell fills the priest with berserk rage. While in this <em class="spellname">Fury</em>, the priest cannot cast spells, for he is completely enveloped in the battle at hand.</p>

					<p>It raises the priest's Strength to 18/00 (+3 To Hit and +6 to damage), and it <em class="spell">Hastes</em> the priest (double normal movement and -4 on initiative rolls). The priest suffers a +2 AC penalty and loses any bonus to AC for Dexterity. The caster may make no defensive actions, and cannot retreat from combat.</p>

					<p>A more dangerous drawback is the strain put upon the body of the priest. For every round the priest remains in the <em class="spellname">Fury</em>, he suffers 1d4 HP damage from muscles tearing and blood vessels rupturing. Once the spell ends the caster will often be left panting, sweating and foaming at the mouth, with terribly bloodshot eyes.</p>

					<p>The spell duration may not be cut short by the caster, and so it may become necessary to physically restrain them if the battle should end prematurely. Otherwise the caster will charge off, in search of other enemies.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>Casting a <em class="spellname">Gate</em> has two effects: it opens a doorway between the Realm the caster occupies and that of his patron deity, and it delivers a plea or request to a being that dwells there. This might be the God in person, or one of their underlings.</p>

					<p>The result is that the sought-after being can step through the portal, if it so desires. The actions of the being that comes through depend on many factors, including the caster's recent behaviour, the nature of those accompanying him, and who or what opposes or threatens the priest. The DM will decide the exact result of the spell, based on the creature called, the desires of the caster and the needs of the moment.</p>

					<p>Casting this spell ages the priest by 10% of their normal lifespan.</p>

					<p>By means of this spell, the priest can bloat one or more normal-sized insects (including arachnids) into larger forms. The resulting creatures are under the command of the caster.</p>

					<p>If the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect, the insects die and the spell is ruined.</p>

					<p>Only one type of insect can be altered at one time and all insects affected must be grown to the same size. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available. The number of insects and the size to which they can be grown depends upon the priest's level:</p>

					<table>
						<caption>Insects affected by Caster level</caption>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th>Caster level</th>
								<th>Maximum insect HD</th>
								<th>Total HD</th>
							</tr>

						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p>Insects can carry 80 lbs / HD; large enough flying insects could carry a human rider.</p>

					<p>If the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, these are example statblocks:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><em>Giant Insect I</em> (3 HD)</li>
						<li><em>Giant Insect II</em> (4 HD)</li>
						<li><em>Giant Insect III</em> (5 HD)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Giant Insects</em> do not attempt to harm the priest, but his control of such creatures is limited to the simplest of commands ('<em>attack</em>,' '<em>defend</em>,' '<em>follow</em>', '<em>stop</em>,' and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them.</p>

					<p>The reverse of the spell, <em class="spellname">Shrink Insect</em>, reduces the size of any unintelligent giant insect. The number of HD affected by the priest is subtracted from the HD of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 HD has been shrunk to normal size.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>By casting this spell the priest creates a specially prepared object, of a kind appropriate to his faith, as a powerful gift for another creature. When enchanting the object, the caster must choose which of the two possible effects it can use: it can transport the possessor to the priest's sacred abode, or bring the priest to them.</p>

					<p>Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it to the chosen individual and tell him the command word or phrase. No other creature can use the power, even if they can take the object and know the command. Only one such empowered object can be created by a given priest; if they create a second, the first loses all power.</p>

					<p>When the first version of the spell is activated, the individual and his possessions are instantly transported to the abode of the priest. This must be a singular place, consecrated to his faith. If the area is deconsecrated, this version of <em class="spellname">Gift Of Succour</em> will fail when it is triggered. In either case, the power in the item is ended. The priest does not have to be present in the area for the traveller to arrive there.</p>

					<p>The second version of the spell transports the priest and his carried possessions to the immediate vicinity of the item. Again, this discharges the enchantment in the object.</p>

					<p>Both versions of <em class="spellname">Gift Of Succour</em> can operate across Realms, although magical effects that impede <em>teleportation</em> magic will block the effect.</p>

					<p>The enchanted item is subject to physical destruction and magics such as <em class="spell priest">Break Sorcery</em> and <em class="spell priest">Dispel Powers</em>. It may be protected with defensive magics of the caster's faith (such as <em class="spell priest">Glyph Of Warding</em>) to help prevent it being harmed.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell confers intelligence upon a mundane animal. The long Casting Time involves constant companionship of the animal, during which period no harmful influences must be allowed to affect it, nor may the caster approach or associate with another beast. Aggressive animals may resist companionship and so require some other magic or talent to keep them amenable.</p>

					<p>Once the spell is cast, the beast must make a Save vs. Con. Failing the roll pains and confuses the animal - predators will usually turn to attack the caster; others will flee his presence.</p>

					<p>Success indicates that the creature's Intelligence is increased to 1d4+5. The animal also acquires a basic understanding of one language known by the caster. This spell does not usually grant the recipient the power of speech, since few animals can produce the complex sounds. However, certain birds known to mimic human speech may become able to converse properly.</p>

					<p>Only a <em class="spell">Petty Wish</em> or <em class="spell">Wish</em> will reverse this spell's effects. Awakened intelligence is not passed on to offspring.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell is similar to <em class="spellname">Glyph Of Warding</em>, in that it inscribes a rune or sigil of power upon a surface which discharges its energies into a victim.</p>

					<p>Unlike that spell, <em class="spellname">Glyph Of Smiting</em> is cast upon a melee weapon wielded by the priest. To do so, the caster must draw the symbol upon the weapon, where it will remain, distinct and visible, perhaps glowing or smoking, as appropriate to the caster's faith.</p>

					<p>In combat, the first successful attack with the weapon discharges the <em class="spellname">Glyph</em>. The magic affects only the creature hit, but will destroy the weapon unless a Save is made. Damage from the <em class="spellname">Glyph</em> replaces any normal weapon damage, and applies even if the weapon itself would usually be unable to harm the target.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A <em class="spellname">Glyph Of Warding</em> is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent enemies from passing, entering, or opening whatever it protects. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Multiple <em class="spellname">Glyphs</em> cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.</p>

					<p>When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. The sigil can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. When the spell is completed, the tracery fades and becomes invisible.</p>

					<p>The priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded area without speaking the name of the <em class="spellname">Glyph</em> is subject to the magic it stores.</p>

					<p>Alternatively, a <em class="spellname">Glyph</em> can be set to activate according to physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and weight. <em class="spellname">Glyphs</em> can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those of the caster's faith. They cannot detect class, HD, or level. </p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Glyphs</em> can be dispelled by magic, or foiled by a successful <em>Find / Remove Traps</em> at a penalty of -5.</p>

					<p>Casting <em class="spellname">Good Berry</em> upon a handful of freshly picked berries makes 2d4 of them magically nourishing.</p>

					<p>The caster, any other 3rd+ lvl priest of the same faith, or a casting of <em class="spellname">Detect Divine Influence</em> can immediately discern which berries are affected and which are not. Eating enchanted berries will immediately reveal which have received the benefits of the spell; they will be sweet and delicious, with a flavour unlike any other.</p>

					<p>A single enchanted <em class="spellname">Good Berry</em> provides enough nourishment to sustain a man-sized creature for a day, and also cures 3 points of HP damage. A creature can only eat a maximum of three <em class="spellname">Berries</em> in a day.</p>

					<p>This spell brings into existence a great image of a holy symbol of the priest's faith, which hangs in the air before the caster.</p>

					<p>While it remains, the caster must meditate upon his faith, maintaining Full <em>Concentration</em>. Any follower of that faith who can keep the <em class="spellname">Sign</em> in view receives a +1 bonus To Hit and damage. Similarly, any priest or devout follower of an enemy cult suffers a -1 penalty To Hit and damage while the symbol remains in their view. Followers of faiths neutral to the caster are unaffected.</p>

					<p>Keeping the eyes averted will negate all effects of this spell, but will mean that a creature suffers a penalty of -2 To Hit in melee. Various other magics or phenomena can block sight of the <em class="spellname">Great Sign</em>.</p>

					<p>This spell can only be used upon non-magical hooved creatures, such as cattle or horses. It imbues them with a vital but exhausting energy - the affected animals will begin to pant heavily and become restless and wild-eyed, eager to gallop off.</p>

					<p>Animals that are not being ridden will need to be calmed via an <em>Animal Handling</em> NWP roll, or will charge off in a random direction for the duration. Mounts can be directed, but if their rider wishes to slow an animal down from a full gallop a <em>Riding</em> NWP roll will be needed to restrain them.</p>

					<p>The animals' normal maximum speed is increased by 25%, and they become able to jump 50% higher and further. Once the duration expires, the animal will all but collapse, being unable to jump or move faster than a slow walk for 10 x the duration in minutes.</p>

					<p>This spell can be used on the same animal more then once a day - but each time, after the first, has a 20% cumulative chance of causing the creature to collapse and die once the duration expires.</p>

Otherwise, the <em class="spellname">Plague</em> remains at the spot designated by the caster and fills the AOE.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Insect Plague</em> obscures vision, limiting it to 10 ft. within the swarm. Creatures in the cloud not in sealed coverings suffer 5 HP damage / round from hundreds of bites and stings; spellcasting within the swarm requires a <em>Concentration</em> roll.</p>

					<p>Living creatures with 2 HD / lvls or less caught in the <em class="spellname">Insect Plague</em> will automatically flee as fast as they can in a random direction, until they are more than 800 ft. away from it. Creatures with 2+3 to 5 HD / lvls can Save vs. Wisdom to resist this terror; those with more HD / lvls are immune to it.</p>

					<p>Strong winds, heavy smoke, poison gases and large fires will drive the insects away within their own AOE, although a smaller fire, such as a torch, is ineffective. If such an effect can cover the entire <em class="spellname">Plague</em> area, it will end the spell by dispersing the swarm. Blows, lightning and cold have no effect.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>With this spell, the druid causes an confusing trail to appear. It will function only in a natural setting with abundant plant growth, such as a forest.</p>

					<p>The druid needs two branches from an oak tree to cast the spell. The first branch is planted at the beginning of the trail. The druid then walks the route that he wishes the <em class="spellname">Meandering Path</em> to follow. At the end of the path the other branch is planted, and the spell is cast.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Meandering Path</em> may seem to be newly laid, old and overgrown, or any in other state that the caster can visualise. Those who happen on the <em class="spellname">Path</em> must attempt a Save (one roll for a group, based on the best chance amongst them). If the Save fails, the trail will appear to be heading in their direction. A successful Save indicates that the group is not drawn onto the <em class="spellname">Path</em>. The caster and anyone he is leading are immune.</p>

					<p>Creatures travelling on this trail will actually be moving along a lengthy, meandering route that is partially through the otherworldly Realm of <em>Logres</em>, with many switch-backs and false trails, although to them the path will appear to turn as normal. Their journey will take five times longer than usual, and may be planned by the druid to avoid or pass through certain areas, anywhere within three miles of the true route. Creatures encountered by a group moving on the <em class="spellname">Path</em> <em>Surprise</em> them at a -3 penalty, seeming to appear from around a previously unseen turning.</p>

					<p>Should a traveller try to leave the trail, they will find that it is bordered by (previously unseen) heavy thorn bushes, blocking passage with equivalent effects to the spells <em class="spell priest">Wall Of Thorns</em> and <em class="spell priest">Entangle</em>. Digging, tunnelling, flying or <em class="spell">Levitating</em> away are also not possible; any progress apparently made will bring would-be escapees back to the same point.</p>

					<p>Because of the confusing nature of the <em class="spellname">Path</em>, spells such as <em class="spell">Teleport</em>, <em class="spell">Open The Way</em> and <em class="spell">Dimension Door</em> also bring the caster back to the trail where they left it, unable to visualise their actual position. <em class="spell priest">Pass Without Trace</em> and <em class="spell priest">Tree</em> are also countered by the <em class="spellname">Meandering Path</em>.</p>

					<p>The only ways of escaping the trail are to enter the Realm Ethereal, to use <em class="spell priest">Find The Path</em>, or to <em class="spell priest">Break</em> the effect. Otherwise, it must be travelled to its end.</p>

					<p>Once a given creature has travelled the entire <em class="spellname">Path</em>, they may in future move along it without a time penalty, and lead others so they can ignore the effects.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the priest to fuse his body and possessions into a single block of stone, be it a castle wall or a sizeable boulder. The stone must be large enough to completely accommodate his body. When the casting is complete, the priest and not more than 100 lbs. of non-living equipment merge with the stone.</p>

					<p>While within, the priest remains in contact with the face of the stone by which he entered, and can feel whatever may touch it, although he is unable to see or hear. The priest remains aware of the passage of time.</p>

					<p>Minor damage to the stone does not harm the priest, but its partial destruction, enough so that the caster no longer fits, expels the priest with 4d8 HP damage. Complete destruction of the stone expels the priest and slays him instantly, unless he rolls a successful Save.</p>

					<p>The magic lasts for 20+1d8 rounds, with the variable part rolled secretly by the DM; once it expires the caster is ejected from the face of the stone.</p>

					<p>A priest uses this spell to summon a small flying animal, usually a bird, to serve him as a <em class="spellname">Messenger</em>. It will work only if there is such a beast within range. If the animal has more than 2 HD or possesses more than 12 Intelligence, it may Save to negate the summons.</p>

					<p>A message may be attached to the animal by whatever means present themselves. It will then fly off to find a specific individual of the caster's choice, whom the priest must describe in detail and whose approximate whereabouts are known. The area it will search may be up to 10 square miles in size, but it must be accessible to the animal. The recipient must be in the area when the animal arrives or the message will not be delivered.</p>

					<p>It is possible for the <em class="spellname">Messenger</em> to be slain by natural predators or other hazards while travelling, as specified by the DM. The base chance is 10%, modified by the place and time of the casting, the recipient's locale and other such factors.</p>

					<p>This spell grants the priest a great prophetic vision of what is to come. It can be cast on behalf of another creature, who must be present, or else for the purposes of the caster himself.

Valuable goods that are sacrificed will go into the coffers of the faith, or else be destroyed and gifted to the deity in question.</p>

					<p>The casting of <em class="spellname">Oracular Vision</em> sends the priest into a hazy trance, during which time they may speak in strange tongues and with alien voices not their own. They may also collapse, or convulse, even foam at the mouth, and may bleed from eyes and ears, such is the urgency and power of the sights coursing through them.</p>

					<p>What is revealed is always the truth, although usually couched in dreamlike metaphor and allegory. Very few details will be given, and it is rare that exact timings can be deciphered. The fortunes of powerful beings such as kings are bound up with their holdings, and may involve their entire kingdom and subjects.</p>

					<p>The globe of protection of this spell is identical in all respects to a <em class="spell priest">Protective Aura</em>, except that it encompasses a much larger area.</p>

					<p>The effect is centred on and moves with the creature touched. Any protected creature within the circle can break the warding against conjured monsters if they enter melee against them.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>All attacks made against the protected creatures suffer -2 penalties To Hit; any Saves caused by such attacks are made with +2 bonuses.</li>
						<li>The spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an other-worldly or conjured nature (including familiars, gargoyles and homonculi). This causes the melee attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil. Attackers can project missiles into the area, however, at the above -2 penalty To Hit.</li>
						<li>Any attempt to possess the protected creatures (e.g. via <em class="spell">Magic Jar</em>) or to exercise mental control over them is blocked. If it was in place before the <em class="spellname">Aura</em> is cast, control will not be broken, but will be held in abeyance until the <em class="spellname">Aura</em> ends.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>If a creature too large to fit into the AOE is the recipient of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <em class="spell priest">Protective Aura</em> spell, for that creature only.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Aura</em> ends if the central protected creature makes a melee attack against a blocked creature or tries to force the barrier against one.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>This spell summons a safeguard for the priest's spirit, in the form of a creature of a type appropriate to his faith; usually a small bird, fish or mammal. The animal will accept a fragment of the caster's soul and keep it safe until needed.</p>

					<p>In order to cast <em class="spellname">Protector Of The Spark</em>, the priest must be in a natural area where such a creature may normally be found. When the Casting Time has been completed, the animal will arrive. The caster must touch it, and at that time choose to transfer a number of HP, to a maximum of 1 / level. The animal will then leave.</p>

					<p>While the beast lives, the caster loses an equivalent number of HP. They can be injured and knocked unconscious as usual, but will not bleed once their new HP total drops below 0. Only more injuries will reduce their HP further. They are also immune to the effects of the following spells:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><em class="spell priest">Command</em></li>
						<li><em class="spell">Essence Of Inchoate Dread</em></li>
						<li><em class="spell priest">Power Of Command</em></li>
						<li><em class="spell priest">Remove Fear</em> (reversed)</li>
						<li><em class="spell">Subtle Voice Of Reason</em></li>
					</ul>

					<p>At that time, if they can be reached, the <em class="spellname">Protector</em> will make their way to the caster, arriving in 2d6 minutes. If they cannot be reached, the <em class="spellname">Protector</em> will wait until they are in an accessible place. Once it arrives, the touch of the animal will restore the gifted HP, and end the spell.</p>

					<p>While the magic persists, the <em class="spellname">Protector</em> will show an aura as appropriate to the caster's faith. It will avoid all contact with other beings, but can be killed by 1 HP of damage from any source. If it is slain, the caster is immediately rendered unconscious, and will begin to bleed. This injury can be healed by normal or magical means.</p>

					<p>The priest can choose to end the spell at any time by recalling the animal. This will take 2d6 minutes, and require that the caster be in an area accessible by the creature. Again, the touch of the creature will restore the gifted HP.</p>

					<p>If cast upon a subject who follows a foreign faith, the victim is allowed a Save. However, if a <em class="spellname">Quest</em> is just and deserved, a follower of the priest's faith cannot avoid it, and any creature of the priest's alignment has a -3 penalty to the Save.</p>

					<p>If the service is not properly followed due to disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature affected by the spell loses 1 from its Save rolls each day. The effects of this debilitation may be visible upon the quest-bearer as marks, bruises, a feverish lassitude or similar, as appropriate to the faith of the caster. If the <em class="spellname">Quest</em> is properly pursued again, this penalty is reduced by 1 every 3 days.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Quest</em> cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by a priest of the same faith and a higher level than the caster. The caster can also choose to end the obligation at any time.</p>

The body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts remain missing when the person is brought back to life. Likewise, existing ills, such as poison and disease, are not negated.</p>

					<p>The recipient must roll a <em>System Shock</em> check, and permanently loses 1 point of Constitution. The <em class="spellname">Raised</em> person returns weak and helpless, with 1 HP, needing a minimum of one full day of rest for each day they were dead.

					<p>This spell affords the recipient a one-time protection from the touch of powerful undead and similar necromantic forces.</p>

						<li><em>Barrow-wights</em></li>
						<li><em>Ghosts</em></li>

					<p>If such a protected creature is struck by such an attack, the energies cancel out with a bright flash of light and a thunderclap. The protected creature suffers only normal HP damage from the attack, with no attribute drain. If the attack was the touch of an undead creature, it suffers 2d6 HP damage from the backlash.</p>

					<p>By bestowing <em class="spellname">Resurrection</em> upon a dead creature, the priest is able to restore life and complete strength to them. The creature can have been dead for up to 10 years / caster level, and need not be whole in body, as long as some part of their remains is available. It is not possible to <em class="spellname">Resurrect</em> a pure-blooded Elf, for reasons unknown.</p>

					<p>This spell will also fail (and the caster will understand why) if the the intended recipient has pledged their soul to another. Certain unpleasant cults know of ritual methods to bar a being from <em class="spellname">Resurrection</em> by taking their essence for themselves.</p>

					<p>The recipient must make a <em>System Shock</em> roll, but is otherwise immediately restored to full HP, and can perform strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age. Those that return will forever carry a strange and otherworldly aura, which marks them as a bearer of great divine mercy.</p>

					<p>Casting this spell greatly depletes the priest's own strength, making him unable to cast further spells or engage in combat. This continues until he rests for one day per lvl / HD of the recipient. The caster also ages 5% of their normal lifespan upon casting this spell.</p>

					<p>The reverse, <em class="spellname">Utter Destruction</em>, requires a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and does not age the caster. The victim is allowed a Save (with a -3 penalty). If the Save is successful, the victim receives 8d6 HP damage. If not, the victim instantly crumbles to dust. A <em class="spellname">Resurrection</em> or <em class="spell">Wish</em> is required to recover them. </p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Ring</em> of this spell's title is a defensive circle formed by priests of the same faith, within which others benefit from a protective force.</p>

					<p>The spell must be cast simultaneously by two or more priests. After casting, the priests link hands so as to form an unbroken circle, usually around one or more persons they wish to protect, with the priests facing outwards.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Ring</em> is of a 3 ft. radius for each participating priest, and can protect medium-sized creatures as follows:</p>

					<p>All the priests and those within the <em class="spellname">Ring</em> gains a +3 bonus to Saves and +3 AC, and are immune to mind-controlling magics emanating from outside.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Ring</em> is immobile; the priests involved cannot fight nor cast spells, although they retain full AC, excepting shields. Those protected within the <em class="spellname">Ring</em> may cast spells or use missiles and polearms to attack foes outside, but suffer a -2 penalty To Hit.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Ring Of Hands</em> ends if any of the participating priests is knocked unconscious, can no longer stand, or if the handclasps are broken; a heavy enough impact will suffice.</p>

			<h4>3rd lvl Alteration, Enchantment</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>6</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>180 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>10 ft. x 10 ft. square / caster level</dd>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell can be used wherever any moderately dense plant growth is found. The ground-covering vegetation or roots and rootlets in the area becomes very hard and sharply pointed. The ground cover will appear to be unchanged, but acts as if the area were strewn with caltrops. In areas of bare ground or earthen pits, roots and rootlets act in the same way.</p>

					<p>Without the use of <em class="spell priest">True Seeing</em>, <em class="spell priest">Detect Snares And Pits</em>, or similar powers, an area affected by <em class="spellname">Thorns And Barbs</em> is undetectable until a victim enters the area. Even then, the creature cannot determine the extent of the perilous area unless magical detection is used.</p>

					<p>For each 10 feet of movement through the area, the victim suffers 2d4 HP damage. He must also make a Save. A failure injures the user's feet, so that their movement rate is reduced to 1/3 for 24 hours. Very heavy or hard-skinned creatures may be immune to <em class="spellname">Thorns And Barbs</em>.</p>

					<p>Magical fire will automatically destroy <em class="spellname">Thorns And Barbs</em> over its area, and various plant-affecting spells such as <em class="spell priest">Speak With Plants</em> can be used to counter the effect.</p>

					<p>This magic consigns a foe to a prison in the otherworldly Realm of <em>Logres</em>, the True World Beyond. It affects a single target, who must be touched for the spell to function.</p>

					<p>The victim rapidly fades from view, and finds themselves in a lightless earthern chamber, no larger than a small room. The chamber is walled in soft, fertile soil, with huge oaken roots forming the supports of the roof.</p>

					<p>Big beetles, worms and the like skitter about in the <em class="spellname">Vault</em> - the non-squeamish can survive by eating them and drinking the brackish water that drips from the roots, if they have no other provisions.</p>

					<p>It is possible to tunnel out of the <em class="spellname">Vault</em>, although the soil is very crumbly and soft. It may require many hours or days to do so; eventually the prisoner will find themselves beneath the boughs of a vast tree in the endless forest of the Realm. Other magics which allow passage through solid objects will work similarly. The best escape method is to cross Realms via various <em>Ethereal</em> spells, which will allow the victim to return directly to the Mundane Realm.</p>

					<p>If the victim does not escape, they will eventually fade back to the spot they last occupied in the Mundane Realm, once the spell's duration expires.</p>

					<p>By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any unaligned animal of up to 2 HD / caster level and Int 1-4 that he desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful Save when the Casting Time begins, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster truly wishes to be the animal's companion. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal will sense them and flee or attack.</p>

					<p>The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Int it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet, and cannot be complex. Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of befriending the creature.</p>

					<p>During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly.</p>

					<p>The maximum total HD of animals that can be befriended at one time is twice the caster's level. Harming any companion creature will break the spell and free it to act as it normally would.</p>

					<p>It is usually obvious to onlookers when someone affected tries to lie and fails, as a verbal stumble usually ensues. A secondary Save, vs. Charisma, may allow a liar to hide their stumble and carry on speaking without pause.</p>

					<p>A succesful Save only allows a speaker to tell a single untruth; any new lie requires another Save.</p>

			<h4>2nd lvl Conjuration</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>3 minutes</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>1 mile</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>One animal</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>1 hour / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Using this spell, the caster can call upon a local mundane animal and ask it to guard a particular area or person.</p>

					<p>The caster must choose an animal species when the spell is being cast. If the desired animal type exists within range, a typical member of the species will then arrive nearby, and the caster can begin to converse with the animal, offering a bargain of some sort. The DM will adjudicate the bargain, considering the spell duration.</p>

					<p>For the spell duration, the animal will protect the defended creature or area, by attacking if necessary, although if it is badly injured it will flee to find the caster.</p>

					<p>Once the spell ends, the animal will attempt to find the priest and report. It will not travel more than 1 mile per caster level to find him, and may well be confounded by barriers or magical concealment. If so, it returns to its original business.</p>

			<h3>Weather Summoning</h3>
			<h4>6th lvl Conjuration <span class="spelltype" data-filttype="Elemental">Elemental</span></h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>10 minutes</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>0</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>By this spell, the caster calls forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area he occupies.</p>

					<p>The following are examples, but other weather types are available:</p>

					<dl class="detailed">
						<dt>Spring</dt><dd>Thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather</dd>
						<dt>Summer</dt><dd>Torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm</dd>
						<dt>Autumn</dt><dd>Hot or cold weather, fog, sleet</dd>
						<dt>Winter</dt><dd>Great cold, blizzard, or thaw conditions</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the later winter or early spring.</p>

					<p>Within an hour after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather to come is apparent - e.g., clearing skies, gusts of warm or hot air, a chill breeze, or overcast skies. Summoned weather arrives 1d12+5 x 10 minutes after the spell is cast.</p>

					<p>The summoned weather is not under the control of the caster, and cannot be stopped once set in motion, except by another casting of the spell. It might last just ten minutes (in the case of a tornado), or for hours or even days in other cases. The AOE likewise varies from about 1 square mile to 100 square miles.</p>

					<p>Several casters of the same faith can act in concert to summon very extreme weather conditions. Alternatively, an opposing caster can use <em class="spellname">Weather Summoning</em> to nullify the effects of a previous casting.</p>

			<h3>Withdraw</h3>
			<h4>2nd lvl Alteration</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>5</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>0</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>Caster only</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>By means of a <em class="spellname">Withdraw</em> spell, the priest gains added moments to spend in reflection.</p>

					<p>While but one round of time passes, the priest is able to spend two rounds, plus one round per level, in contemplation. The DM should allow the player one minute of real time per round <em class="spellname">Withdrawn</em> to ponder some problem or question.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Withdrawn</em> caster cannot walk or run, or engage in actions other than thinking, reading, and the like. They cannot cast spells, other than <em>divination</em>, <em>curing</em> or <em>healing</em> magics.</p>

					<p>While <em class="spellname">Withdrawn</em>, the caster can be affected by the actions of others, losing any Dexterity or shield bonus if attacked.</p>

			<h3>Woodwrath</h3>
			<h4>5th lvl Enchantment</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>1 hour</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>150 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>100 ft. square / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>1 day / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell wakens vengeful spirits in an area of woods or forest, and sets them against the caster's foes.</p>

					<p>Once cast, the woods take on a foreboding aspect, obvious to all who enter - shadows become deeper, the forest sounds more mysterious, and the wind through the branches seems to make them twist and grasp at intruders. After being in the woods for 10 minutes enemies of the caster of 2 HD or less must make a Save, or flee in fear for 2d10 minutes.</p>

					<p>Foes will find that their movement is impeded by dense thorn bushes and undergrowth; they move at half rate in the enchanted forest. Every 1d6 rounds after the first 10 minutes, each must make a Save or be 'attacked' by a whipping tree-branch, a tripping hazard such as a fallen log, a thorn-mat or similar (at THACO 15, damage 1d6).</p>

					<p>Those who actively seek to hack or burn the plants of the wood will be attacked <em>every</em> round, both by the trees and foliage and by enraged animals, with effects as above.</p>

					<p>Finally, any attempt to <em class="spellname">Charm</em>, enthrall or befriend creatures of the forest by the caster's enemies will be at -3 for the duration.</p>

			<h3>Word Of Recall</h3>
			<h4>6th lvl Alteration</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>1</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>Across Realms; see below</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell takes the priest instantly back to his sanctuary when the <em class="spellname">Word Of Recall</em> is uttered.</p>

					<p>The priest is also able to transport 25 extra lbs / caster level. This extra material can be equipment, treasure, or additional creatures, as long as they are being touched. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.</p>

					<p>The sanctuary must be specifically designated in advance by the priest, and must be a singular place, consecrated to his faith. If the area is deconsecrated, <em class="spellname">Word Of Recall</em> will fail when activated.</p>

					<p>Transportation by <em class="spellname">Word Of Recall</em> is safe over any distance within a Realm, but for each Realm the priest is removed, there is a 5% cumulative chance that the caster is irrevocably lost.</p>
