				<dd>
					<p>This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters - skeletons or zombies. <em>Skeletons</em> are collections of bones, given animation by a malevolent demon-fragment, whereas <em>zombies</em> retain some hateful and bestial part of their own original spirit. The remains of Elves cannot be used to create zombies, for reasons unknown.</p>

					<p>This spell assumes that the bodies or bones are available and are reasonably intact (those of undead skeletons or zombies destroyed in combat will not be).</p>

					<p>The risen undead will obey the simple verbal commands of the caster; for example, they can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or only a specific type of creature) entering, and so on.</p>

					<p>The following types of dead creatures can be animated:</p>

					<dl class="detailed">
						<dt>S-sized</dt>
						<dd>The caster can animate two skeletons per level or one zombie per level. The creatures have 1/2 HD as skeletons and 1 HD as zombies.</dd>
						<dt>M-sized</dt>
						<dd>The caster can animate one <em>skeleton</em> for each caster level, or one <em>zombie</em> for every two caster levels.</dd>
						<dt>L-sized</dt>
						<dd>The number of undead animated is determined by the monsters' original HD (the total HD cannot exceed the caster's level). Skeletal forms have the HD of the original creature, while zombie forms have one more Hit Die.</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>Smaller and larger animated undead will have the usual AC and movement for a <em>skeleton</em> or <em>zombie</em>, but adjusted THACO and damage caused in proportion to their size.</p>

					<p>The undead remain animated until they are destroyed; the magic cannot be dispelled.</p>

					<p>A given caster can command twice the given number of undead above through multiple castings of <em class="spellname">Animate Dead</em>. It is possible to continue to cast beyond this limit, but uncontrolled skeletons and zombies will seek to slay all living things nearby, including the caster.</p>

					<p>The casting of this spell is not a good act, and only evil beings use it frequently.</p>

			<h3>Animate Mist</h3>
			<h4>1st lvl Alteration <span class="spelltype" data-filttype="Elemental">Elemental</span></h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>1</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>90 ft.</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>5 ft. radius / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>2d4 rounds + 1 round / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell allows a wizard to shape and animate existing smoke, mist or fog within the confines of the AOE.</p>

					<p>The details of the shape and the complexity of its movement are poor at lower caster levels, but improve with experience. A sufficient amount of smoke, fog or mist be present when the spell is cast.</p>

					<p>For example, a 1st-level wizard is able to make a blurry, stocky humanoid shape, but cannot make it look like a dwarf. He could cause it to clumsily drift through the mist, as long as it remains within the spell's range.</p>

					<p>By 3rd level, a wizard can create a shape that resembles a dwarf made of mist, and have it walk it about in a realistic manner. At this level, unwary observers may believe that the shapes are real creatures or objects, although a successful passive or active <em>Disbelief</em> roll will reveal their true nature.</p>

					<p>The spell requires that the caster maintain Full <em>Concentration</em> and remain within range, or else the mist loses its form.</p>

					<p>This spell is believed to be the creation of <em>Jormunrek</em>, a magician of the barbarous Northlands.</p>

					<p>This powerful spell enables the caster to summon demonic spirits to imbue one or more inanimate objects with a semblance of life. The <em class="spellname">Animated Objects</em> then attack whatever foes the caster designates.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Objects</em> can be of any unenchanted material, including wood, metal, stone, and fabrics. Attempting to animate an item in someone's possession grants that person a Save to prevent the spell's effect.</p>

					<p>The stats for <em class="spellname">Animated Objects</em> vary, depending on size and material, as determined by the DM. Many will have special attacks, such as tripping, overbearing and smothering.</p>

					<p>This spell is a more powerful version of <em class="spell">Animate Dead</em>, able to raise the bones of the dead as dangerous skeletal soldiers. It only functions on man-sized humanoid remains, inhabiting them with fragments of spirits from an Infernal netherworld.</p>

					<p>The risen undead will obey the simple verbal commands of the caster; for example, they can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or only a specific type of creature) entering, and so on.</p>

					<p>The undead remain animated until they are destroyed; the magic cannot be dispelled. The following types of dead creatures can be animated and controlled:</p>

					<p>This spell allows its caster to change the flight of a single missile each round, hurling it back at its sender, or at any other creature within its normal range from the sender. For a missile to be affected, it must pass within range of the spell during its flight.</p>

					<p>Reversed missiles can include thrown axes, arrows, bolts, spears, javelins and the like, as long as neither bow nor projectile are magical. It cannot affect catapult stones, hurled boulders, or similar large objects. Any number of <em class="spell">Magic Missiles</em> each round from the same originating caster can also be reversed.</p>

					<p>Such a missile strikes as though wielded by the caster of the <em class="spellname">Retribution</em>, as a proficient weapon, at +2 To Hit, doing its normal damage. A reflected <em class="spell">Magic Missile</em> hits unerringly, as usual.</p>

					<p>Spellcasting, combat or movement are impossible while a wizard is using <em class="spellname">Archer's Retribution</em>; it will end immediately if the mage loses Full <em>Concentration</em>.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>By means of <em class="spellname">Astral Journey</em>, a wizard can project his soul, and those of up to six companions, into the Astral Realm, leaving their physical body and material possessions behind and inert in the Mortal World.</p>

					<p>To travel together, the caster and companion creatures must be linked in a circle. These fellow travellers are dependent upon the caster for guidance, and can be stranded or lost in the Astral Realm. Otherwise they will go with him to his chosen destination.</p>

					<p>The soul-forms can then travel to the other Realms (except the Ethereal), and there form new temporary bodies. Only enchanted items can be brought with them on this journey; mundane objects will have no equivalent elsewhere.</p>

					<p>During this journey, which might take an indeterminate period of time, the travellers' soul-forms are tethered to their material bodies by silvery cords. If a cord is broken, the affected person is killed, Astrally and materially; however, very few forces can sever a cord. If an Astral form is slain while travelling, the cord simply returns to the original body, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. When a second body is formed in another Realm, the silvery cord becomes part of it, until the Astral Realm is entered again.</p>

					<p>While elsewhere, the travellers' bodies are vulnerable. If they are slain while their soul-forms are Astrally travelling, the lost souls go to an unknown fate. If the travellers have already formed new bodies in another Realm, they become forfeit to the powers there, and usually are never seen again.</p>

					<p>In order to regain their bodies, the caster must use <em class="spellname">Astral Journey</em> once more for the return trip.</p>

					<p>This spell is of ancient origin, said to have been first created by the mysterious <em>Sleeper</em>, lost to antiquity.</p>

					<p>This powerful divination attaches an invisible channel to its target, allowing the caster to spy upon them over great distances.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Astral Tether</em> gives the wizard the ability to experience the target's sense impressions at any time they choose. This includes sights, sounds, scents and other impressions. Pain is also transmitted, which can cause the caster some distress.</p>

					<p>While attached to the <em class="spellname">Tether</em>, the target will often feel a nagging sense of being spied upon. The base chance of this happening is equal to the subject's Int as a percentage, modified as follows:</p>

					<dl class="complex-terms">

If it can be kept in sight, it can be followed back to the caster. <em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> can also be used to discover the identity of the wizard who placed the <em class="spellname">Tether</em>.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Tether</em> will snap if the target travels to another Realm, and can also be broken by a successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> or <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em>.</p>

					<p>The maximum noise of the <em class="spellname">Audible Glamer</em> at 1st level is that of four men at their loudest. Each additional caster level adds a like volume. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting.

					<p>Unlikely or poorly-imagined <em class="spellname">Glamers</em> (perhaps created without prior knowledge of the subject) may grant a passive attempt to <em>Disbelieve</em>. In any case, a successful <em>Disbelief</em> attempt will let an observer realise that the sound is an illusion.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p><em class="spellname">Azaelin's Ineluctable Domination</em> enables the caster to control the actions of the target. It affects any single man-sized or smaller humanoid, and a Save is allowed to resist it. It operates much like <em class="spell">Charm Person</em>, but is more powerful, and does not require verbal commands to function.</p>

					<p>Success means the wizard has established an unspoken link with the subject. If a common language is shared, the wizard can generally force the subject to perform as the wizard desires, although the caster does not receive direct sensory input from the subject. While <em class="spellname">Dominated</em>, the subject is conscious of the caster's power over them, but will be unable to resist, other than as outlined below.</p>

					<p>Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new Save with a bonus of +1 to +3, depending on how extreme the action is. Obviously self-destructive orders will not be followed. Once control is established, there is no limit to the range at which it can be exercised, as long as the caster and subject are within the same Realm. Affected creatures have periodic chances to break the spell:</p>

					<h5>Time between Saves:</h5>
					<dl class="simple">
						<dt>Int 3 or less</dt><dd>3 months</dd>
						<dt>4-6</dt><dd>2 months</dd>

						<dt>17</dt><dd>3 days</dd>
						<dt>18</dt><dd>2 days</dd>
						<dt>19 or more</dt><dd>1 day</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>The exact timing of the check is secretly determined by the DM.</p>

					<p>An <em class="spell">Aura Of Protection</em> can prevent the caster from exercising control or using the mental link while the subject is warded, but it cannot prevent the establishment of <em class="spellname">Domination</em>.</p>

					<p>When cast, <em class="spellname">The Barghest's Charnel Feast</em> calls up a hissing halo of black flames, which plays over the dead body and consumes it.

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This wizardry creates a conspicuous force which draws to it undead creatures across long distances; it often results in a gathering of dangerous unliving beings.</p>

					<p>It usually manifests as a great pillar of roiling black smoke, 20 ft. across, stinking of brimstone and dead flesh, which will climb up to 100 ft. if ceiling space allows. The <em class="spellname">Beacon</em> gives off an unsettling buzz, as if composed of millions of angry flies, and radiates a bone-chilling cold. Natural animals will usually flee the area, unless strongly reined in.</p>

					<p>Once placed, it has a wide AOE, within which all mindless undead creatures immediately begin to move at their fastest speed towards the <em class="spellname">Beacon</em>. Willed undead are affected in the same way, but can resist by making a Save - if they then remain within the AOE, every further 5 rounds will necessitate another Save. A master in control of mindless undead can similarly make Saves on his thralls' behalf to force them to ignore the calling.</p>

					<p>Once the unliving reach the <em class="spellname">Beacon</em>, they must remain within 100 ft. of it for the duration, and will follow their usual instincts, attacking or preying on the living nearby. When the spell ends, mindless undead who were under the control of a master will drift back to where they began; willed undead are free to act as they desire.</p>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>Negates</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This powerful but dangerous spell allows the caster to shift his soul into the body of an animal he touches, controlling its actions for the duration. It functions only on normal, non-Dire, non-giant animals. The target is allowed a Save to avoid the effect.</p>

					<p>A controlled animal has its full senses and usual attacks, including poisons and the like, and may move at its usual rate. Its AC and THACO likewise remain the same. The animal cannot speak (except via <em class="spell">Speak With Animals</em>) or cast spells, and its manipulation of objects may be limited. While the caster's soul occupies the beast it is immune to animal-controlling spells, but is affected by <em class="spell">Charm Person</em> and similar magic, which might seem peculiar to witnesses.</p>

					<p>While the caster's soul is elsewhere, his own body lies inert and vulnerable. If his body is slain while in this state his mind remains in the animal body permanently. Should the beast die while containing the caster's soul, he will perish.</p>

					<p>Once the spell duration expires, the caster's soul flies back to his own body, and the animal returns to its normal behaviour.</p>

					<p>This spell is used to confine a creature for a long period; perhaps forever. It is often used in conjunction with a <em class="spell">Great Pentacle</em> to trap an otherworldly enemy, but can also work on a foe native to the Mortal Realm.</p>

					<p>Because of the lengthy Casting Time, the subject will usually need to be restrained beforehand; again, a <em class="spell">Pentacle</em> will often suffice, but there are many other viable methods.</p>

					<p>The caster can choose from several kinds of possible <em class="spellname">Binding</em>, detailed below. In each case a standard Save applies, modified by the method used.</p>

					<p>The <em>Bound In Shackles</em> and <em>Bound And Bottled</em> methods require additional materials (chains and a container, respectively). These can be of any kind, although it is to the caster's advantage if they are as strong as possible.</p>

					<p>A creature <em>Bound In Shackles</em> or <em>Bound In Shade</em> can converse with nearby beings. No <em class="spellname">Bound</em> creature can take other actions or cast spells, however.</p>

					<p>Casting this spell brings into being a sorcerous blade in the caster's grip, usually a knife or dagger, but it can be up to the size of a longsword.</p>

					<p>It can be used to make one attack per round, at a +2 bonus To Hit. The <em class="spellname">Blade of Fell Aspect</em> does not inflict normal damage, instead causing one of three possible effects on a hit. One must be selected by the caster prior to any blow.</p>

						<li>The <em class="spellname">Blade</em> can drain from any creature it hits the exact HPs necessary to heal all current damage to the sword-wielder (up to the maximum possessed by the target).</li>
						<li>The touch of the <em class="spellname">Blade</em> can inflict 1 HP physical damage and a <em class="spell">Wizard's Curse</em> (as the spell; effect chosen by the wielder). A given target can only bear one such <em class="spell">Curse</em> at a time.</li>

					<p>While holding the weapon, the wielder cannot cast another spell.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Blade of Fell Aspect</em> passes into nothingness in an instant if it leaves the caster's hand (it cannot be sheathed to be wielded again later). However, it cannot be knocked or wrestled from his grip. It also vanishes instantly if the caster dies or becomes unconscious.</p>

					<p>Separation of the caster from a victim by an obviously impenetrable or uncrossable boundary breaks the spell, but otherwise those failing to Save rush to do battle with the caster. All affected creatures attack the wizard in melee, rather than with missile weapons or spells.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Bridge Of Agonies</em> makes its caster a conduit for injuries and disabilities, allowing him to transfer them from one creature to another.</p>

					<p>It is usually cast upon two conscious and willing subjects, as the caster needs to touch each for the entire Casting Time of the spell. Occasionally one or both of the participants is unwilling, immobilised or unconscious; in that case a Save on either part nullifies the <em class="spellname">Bridge</em> effect.</p>

					<p>If the spell takes effect, one of the touched creatures may be healed, up to 2 HP / caster level, by transmitting the damage to the other creature. Additionally a single affliction such as poisoning, a disease, blindness or deafness may be passed from one to the other. The caster decides who is the recipient of each effect, but they have to pass through his own body. If the momentary loss of HP is enough to drop him to 0 HP or less, or if he fails a required Save against a passing disability he takes the full effect himself. If that happens the <em class="spellname">Bridge</em> breaks, and the injuries reside in the caster from then on. Otherwise the disabilities pass on through, and the caster is unharmed.</p>

					<p>Should a recipient be immune to a transmitted disability, they are unable to take it on and the caster absorbs the full effects instead.</p>

					<p>All items gain a Save, with a bonus equal to their magical bonus value or protection. Artifacts and relics constructed of metal may be affected at the discretion of the DM, though it is highly unlikely.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Unrelenting Bodkin</em> has no physical existence. It is invisible to all but the caster and those employing <em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magic</em>, <em class="spell">Second Sight</em> or similar. The blade cannot be touched or attacked. It travels with the victim, and cannot be left behind by <em>Teleportation</em> or travel to other Realms.</p>

					<p>It will fall upon the fulfilment of a single condition, set verbally during its casting. Typical conditions include the target creature uttering a certain name or word; starting to cast a spell; drawing a weapon, or going to sleep. The condition cannot be tied to a specific time or location. Many years can pass between the casting of a <em class="spellname">Unrelenting Bodkin</em> and its fall.</p>

Victims often fall, writhing, to the ground, and must Save vs. Wisdom or cry out in agony.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spell">Petty Wish</em>, <em class="spell">Wish</em>, or similarly powerful magic can destroy the spell unless the casting of that spell is the condition which will cause the <em class="spellname">Bodkin</em> to fall.</p>

					<p>A creature can only have one <em class="spellname">Unrelenting Bodkin</em> waiting above them at a given time.</p>

					<p>The creator of this spell is better known for <em class="spell">Caligarde's Flensing Rain Of Razors</em>, used to slay the Northman High Jarl <em>Herjolf</em> Gnarlfist in centuries past.</p>

					<p>By means of this spell, the caster conjures a normal animal, along with appropriate riding gear, to serve him as a steed.</p>

					<p>The animal serves willingly and well, but at the expiration of the spell duration it disappears, returning to its own place.

					<p>When a wizard wishes to gain supernatural guidance, he casts <em class="spellname">Call Upon Sagacious Powers</em>, contacting some other-worldly entity and asking a single question of import.</p>

					<p>The DM can supply a list of possible Powers that may be called upon. The caster will know which of the available <em class="spellname">Powers</em> are best suited to answer the question in hand, and can attempt to direct the question towards a particular being, but will often find that some other is contacted instead.</p>

					<p>The casting of this spell must be accompanied by the sacrifice of something valued by the <em class="spellname">Power</em>. The more precious the sacrifice, the better the chance of spell success. A very precious item grants a bonus of +1 to the dice roll, an extremely precious item adds +2, and a priceless item adds +3. Many of the darker <em class="spellname">Powers</em> may require a living sacrifice.</p>

					<h5>Results of a Call - roll 2d6:</h5>

					<p>This spell causes the air around a target to instantly coalesce into a rough, irregular block of ice, trapping them within it.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell creates a discharge that begins as a single stroke of <em class="spellname">Lightning</em>, leaping from the fingertips of the caster. Unlike a <em class="spell">Lightning Bolt</em> spell, <em class="spellname">Chain Of Lightning</em> strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to a series of others within range, losing effectiveness with each jump.</p>

					<p>The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 HP damage / caster level, to a maximum of 12d6 (halved on a successful Save). After the first strike, the <em class="spellname">Lightning</em> arcs to the next nearest creature within 50 ft., possibly including the caster. If a large mass of iron or water (over 100 lbs) is within this range, it will contain the arc and halt the spell.</p>

					<p>Each jump reduces the strength of the <em class="spellname">Lightning</em> by 1d6. Any creature hit receives a Save for half damage; those immune to <em class="spellname">Lightning</em> can be struck, even though no damage is taken.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Chain</em> can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the caster has levels, although each target can be struck only once. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of targets, until it strikes a mass of iron or liquid, or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>When <em class="spellname">Chamber Long Vacant</em> is cast, the wizard causes an area to appear to be empty, neglected, and unused.</p>

					<p>Those who enter the area see dust on the floor, cobwebs, dirt, and other conditions, typical of a long-abandoned place. If they pass through the AOE, they seem to leave tracks, tear away cobwebs, and so on. Unless they forcefully collide with some real object cloaked by the spell, the place appears empty.</p>

					<p>This spell can cloak only inanimate things. Living things are not made invisible, but their presence does not otherwise disturb the spell.</p>

					<p>If forceful contact with a cloaked object occurs, those creatures subject to the spell are then entitled to a <em>Disbelief</em> roll. A failure will mean they believe that the object has been made invisible.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spell">Second Sight</em> spell and similar effects can penetrate the deception, but a <em class="spell">Detect Invisibility</em> spell cannot.</p>

					<p>Unlikely or poorly-imagined <em class="spellname">Vacancies</em> (perhaps created in a busy street) may grant a passive attempt to <em>Disbelieve</em>. In any case, a successful <em>Disbelief</em> attempt will let an observer see through the fakery and perceive the area as it truly is.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the wizard to alter his appearance, including clothing and equipment, to appear up to a foot shorter or taller; thin, fat, or in between; and of any generally man-shaped bipedal race. The caster cannot duplicate a specific individual.</p>

					<p>The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor appropriate sounds or odours. If a creature makes physical contact with the caster, they will feel the wizard's true form.</p>

					<p>This spell cannot change the appearance of the caster's shadow. If examined, it will show his normal shape.</p>

					<p>The caster does not need to maintain concentration for the <em class="spellname">Guise</em> to remain in effect, and so can move around, attack, or cast another spell without spoiling the magic.</p>

					<p>The DM may allow a passive roll for <em>Disbelief</em> under certain circumstances; if, for example, the caster acts in a manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen role, or if the caster is touched by another creature. In any case, a successful <em>Disbelief</em> attempt will let an observer realise that the <em class="spellname">Guise</em> is an illusion.</p>

					<p>This spell allows several mages to combine their power, increasing the spell-casting ability of one of their number. It requires at least three wizards, and can involve a maximum of ten.</p>

					<p>The caster of <em class="spellname">Circle Of Power</em> steps into the centre of a ring formed by the other wizards, who must begin a chant in unison. The ring must also be laid with holly branches and dusted with powdered silver.</p>

					<p>The caster gains 1 extra level of spell energy for each other participant in the <em class="spellname">Circle</em>, allowing his spells to be cast at a higher equivalent level. No additional spell slots are gained. Additionally, the caster makes Saves at his new, adjusted level while the ring remains intact.</p>

					<p>While forming a <em class="spellname">Circle Of Power</em>, none of the ring of mages may cast spells, rest, use magical items, nor converse. They lose all Dex bonuses to AC. The caster may pause to speak, rest or take other actions, as long as he does not leave the ring.</p>

					<p>The spell may continue indefinitely, until the chant ends (by enforced silence or fatigue), or the <em class="spellname">Circle</em> is broken (by one of the participants stepping away, being forcibly moved, knocked down or rendered unconscious)</p>

Distance from the wizard is not a factor, but the locale must be known and within the current Realm - familiar or obvious (such as behind a door, around a corner, in a visible copse of trees, and so on).

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>When the first form of this magic is cast, this spell clouds the minds of witnesses, causing them to see the caster as a dull, inconsequential, and unappealing humanoid creature.</p>

					<p>Each observer sees their own unremarkable vision, appropriate to the surroundings. For example, while standing in the Court of Good King Bunderwal, onlookers might see the caster as just another courtier, but while passing through an orcish settlement, anyone looking would see only an unwashed orc thug.</p>

					<p>Any creature in the area actively attempting to find or recognise the caster must make an extensive search, with a -3 penalty to their Perception.</p>

					<p>The spell works best if the recipient is surrounded by similar creatures or objects; the bigger the potential crowd to be lost in, the better the illusion functions. The DM may increase the penalty in these cases.</p>

					<p>This spell may also be cast by touch on an unattended object, which causes it to appear as a mundane or inconsequential item of about the same size and shape. For example, a gem-studded staff might appear as a broom. The size of the object affected cannot be larger than a chair or a suit of armour. Again, a search for the <em class="spellname">Cloaked</em> object suffers a -3 penalty to Perception.</p>

					<p>This form of the spell can be made the subject of a <em class="spell">Permanency</em> spell.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Cloak Of Banality</em> affects all the senses; speaking to a concealed caster or picking up a concealed object will not necessarily reveal them, although another Perception roll at -3 should be made.</p>

					<p>While casting this spell the wizard points to a cloud overhead in an open sky - it only functions outdoors. The cloud will then begin to float down over the next few minutes, changing shape to resemble some kind of sailing vessel as it does so. The caster and up to one passenger / caster level may step onto it as the cloud rises again.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Cloud Galley</em> moves at a speed of up to 50 miles per hour, under the command of the caster. It travels at a height of between 200 and 500 ft. - caster's choice - but it is not very manoeuvrable. The passengers feel no wind from the passage; the cloud surface is soft and comfortable.</p>

					<p>Only the caster and his chosen passengers find the cloud solid; other objects and creatures will pass through it as if through a normal cloud. The <em class="spellname">Galley</em> can be affected by winds and weather magics.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Galley</em> only exists while the caster is conscious and touching it; if he is knocked unconscious or leaves the cloud it becomes insubstantial again, and any passengers or cargo will plummet to the ground.</p>

					<p>When cast, <em class="spellname">Command The Spirits Of The Earth</em> slowly moves dirt, clay, loam and sand. It will allow the caster to collapse embankments, move hillocks, shift sand dunes, or dig trenches. It cannot safely create long, deep tunnels, as they tend to collapse without support.</p>

					<p>The area to be affected dictates the Casting Time; for every 120 ft. x 120 ft. surface area and 10 ft. of depth, ten minutes of Casting Time is required. The maximum area that can be affected is 720 ft. x 720 ft. x 60 ft. deep, which takes one hour.</p>

					<p>This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting like a dense fluid, until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations and the like will not be destroyed, but may shift position as the earth moves.</p>

					<p>The spell effects are generally too gradual to trap or bury any creature, except the very slowest.</p>

					<p>This spell is believed to be of ancient origin, predating the rise of Man's kingdoms.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the wizard to command undead creatures for a short period of time. The spell can affect both mindless and free-willed undead beings.</p>

					<p>Upon casting the spell, the wizard selects a point within range. Those undead nearest to this point are affected, up to a number of HD equal to the caster's level.</p>

					<p>Only undead with 4 or more HD are allowed a Save, which, if successful, negates the attempt. Regardless of the success or failure of the Save, each creature required to make a check counts toward the HD limit of the spell. Any undead currently under the sway of another being (e.g. a more powerful undead) gain a bonus as appropriate for that being's level or HD against this spell.</p>

					<p>Free-willed undead cannot be commanded to act in a self-destructive way, but mindless undead can be ordered to perform any action.</p>

					<p>Once <em class="spellname">Command The Undead</em> ends, the unliving revert to their normal behaviours. Free-willed undead will remember the control exerted by the wizard, and may seek vengeance.</p>

					<p>This ancient spell brings forth a servitor drawn from the Infernal Realms; a dull-witted <em>Brute</em> that follows the caster's spoken commands. It arrives in the midst of a cloud of smoke and brimstone, and will bow before its Master, awaiting orders.</p>

					<p><em>Brutes</em> are hulking man-shaped beings, standing seven feet tall, broad and long-armed, with rasping skin of a dull grey. Their eyes are coloured a malevolent amber, and their talons a yellowish ivory. They can speak haltingly, if they must, but prefer to keep a sullen and resentful silence. <a class="popup" data-img="/images/brute.jpg"></a></p>

					<p>They have a Str of 18(50) and are tireless, able to carry great loads or batter down obstacles. They will enter combat if ordered, but will not don armour or bear weapons, instead striking with their massive clawed hands. They know no fear, and will fight to the death gladly. If slain, their stinking corpses soon melt away into an unidentifiable putrid mass.</p>

					<p>Usually a <em>Brute</em> remains until the next time the sun rises. However, if the caster is prepared to sever one of his own fingers for it to devour, the <em>Brute</em> will remain permanently (unless slain). A sacrificed digit cannot be regrown through any means. These things must also be fed daily on several pounds of raw flesh, if they are to remain. If their Master dies, they will return whence they came.</p>

					<p>This spell requires bone from a sentient being who was murdered; enough to sculpt a one-handed edged weapon. While casting, the wizard runs his hands over the bone, causing it to become straight and sharpened.</p>

					<p>The resulting <em class="spellname">Crypt Blade</em> is identical in size and weight to a normal bladed weapon of its type, although it is obviously made of browning, pitted bone. It can be wielded by any creature proficient in its type.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Blade</em> is unbreakable, until it crumbles into dust at the spell's expiration, and counts as a +3 magical weapon To Hit and damage. Additionally, any wounds it causes bleed copiously until bandaged, or ten rounds pass. Because of this, the victim loses one additional HP per round, per wound, over and above the initial damage.</p>

					<p>Against undead, a <em class="spellname">Crypt Blade</em> does double normal damage, and if the undead fails to Save against the first successful strike, it is instantly destroyed. If the Save succeeds, the unliving being does not need to Save again against later blows.</p>

					<p>All HP lost to this weapon can only be healed through natural rest, not via <em>regeneration</em> or magical means, short of a <em class="spell">Petty Wish</em>.</p>

					<p>Otherwise the victim will see a pursuing clot of darkness, bearing four sets of claws and a gaping, slavering mouth full of sharp teeth. The <em class="spellname">Hunger</em> rushes upon the target at a rate of 40 ft./round. Doors and other solid barriers block the imaginary creature - all within range will hear the thing clawing and scraping to break through.

					<p>If it catches up with the victim, it will attack at THACO 18, using two claws for 1d4 damage and one bite at 1d6. The victim may attack the imaginary beast in melee, but the <em class="spellname">Cryptic Hunger</em> can only be 'injured' by spells or by enchanted weapons. It has AC 4 - when it has taken 16 HP in 'damage' it disappears.</p>

If the new shape can speak and use its limbs well enough, a changed caster can retain his original spellcasting ability. A new shape radically different from the victim's own might impose penalties to their Dex rolls, Initiative, and the like for a period.</p>

					<p>This spell cannot change the appearance of the recipient's shadow. If examined, it will show their normal shape.</p>

The caster can choose the new shape of the victims, which must be of an existing kind he is familiar with. All the victims must be cursed with the same new form.</p>

					<p>Almost all creatures will be traumatised from being forced into a new shape, and very few will welcome the spell. A Save applies. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, dopplegangers, and so on) are affected for only one round, and can then resume their normal form.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Cursed</em> creatures acquire the physical abilities of the new shape, while retaining their own minds. The new shape will confer mundane AC due to toughness and quickness, mundane movement abilities, and mundane, physical attacks. The targets' original THACO, HP and Saves are retained. If the new shape can speak and use its limbs well enough, a changed caster can retain his original spellcasting ability. A new shape radically different from the victim's own might impose penalties to their Dex rolls, Initiative, and the like for a period.</p>

					<p>When the <em class="spellname">Curse</em> takes effect, victims' non-magical equipment, if any, melds into the new form. Magical items will not change, and may fall to the ground or be left behind.</p>

					<p>This spell cannot change the appearance of the recipients' shadows. If examined, they will show their normal shape.</p>

					<p>If slain, <em class="spellname">Cursed</em> creatures revert to their original forms, though they remain dead.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spell priest">Lift Curse</em> or <em class="spell">Remove Curse</em> cast at the same level as the <em class="spellname">Curse</em> can restore a victim's own body.</p>

					<p>The origins of this spell are said to predate the rise of Man's kingdoms.</p>

					<p>This spell is a powerful curse that lies dormant until its unfortunate recipient has died, through whatever means. It may only be cast upon humans or half-breed humans. Three nights after death, they rise as an undead creature, never to know rest again.</p>

					<p>A living creature under the effects of this spell will show up as powerfully cursed to divination, and usually suffers from horrible nightmares until they die.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>With this spell, the wizard causes his body to shift directly from one spot to another, at a random time and in a random direction.</p>

					<p>The spell activates on its own Initiative every round, a roll of 2d6. At that time the wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 ft. distant from his previous position. Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8:</p>

					<dl class="simple">
						<dt>1</dt><dd>right and ahead</dd>

					</dl>

					<p>The caster cannot <em class="spellname">Dance</em> into a solid object; re-roll in this case. If shifting is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster will remain where he is.</p>

					<p>During each round that he shifts, the caster can be attacked only by opponents who beats the spell's Initiative, or by those who are able to affect both locations at once (e.g. with a <em class="spell">Fireball</em>, or similar area effect).</p>

					<p>If the caster wants to wait until after the <em class="spellname">Dance</em>, he must add his own Initiative roll to that of the spell. Alternatively, the caster can try to act before the shift (he must announce his intent before any Initiative rolls). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls. If he beats the spell's roll, he can go first. If not, he will <em class="spellname">Dance</em> first and then acts in whatever direction he's facing. He must complete his intended action, whatever the consequences.</p>

					<p>This unpleasant magic allows a wizard to take on the likeness of a recently-dead person by wearing their face over his own. The corpse can be of any man-shaped creature from hobbit- to gnoll-sized.</p>

					<p>The caster must cut the body's face away by hand and place it on his features. There it will adhere, and the magic grants him that creature's semblance from head to toe. The face that the caster wears must be reasonably intact. Minor wounds it bears will come with it and show in the caster's assumed appearance.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Death Mask</em> does not provide clothing or equipment, nor the person's abilities and mannerisms. If a creature makes physical contact with the caster, they will feel the wizard's true form.</p>

					<p>Any kind of prolonged contact with those who know the creature personally will require the caster to make an <em class="stored nwp">Acting</em> NWP roll, possibly at a penalty, in order to maintain the disguise.</p>

					<p>If creatures of differing HD are affected by <em class="spellname">The Spell Of Death</em>, 4d20 is rolled to determine how many creatures of under 2 HD are affected.

					<p>This spell enables the wizard to specially prepare a garment so as to hold far more than it normally could.</p>

While preparing the talisman, the caster must not be disturbed, or the magic is ruined and the linked object loses its efficacy.</p>

					<p>Once ready, the <em class="spellname">Jawbone</em> must be pointed at the intended victim to take effect, and the caster must chant a brief gutteral phrase, which requires 5 Initiative Counts. The victim can Save to avoid the curse, at a penalty of -3.</p>

					<p>By means of this spell, the caster seeks to force a single creature from another Realm to return to its proper home. If the creature desires to be returned to its home Realm, no Save is necessary; otherwise its <em>Magic Resistance</em> applies.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Dismissal</em> works upon creatures that are physically present, but also can serve to drive a possessing spirit from an unwilling host.

					<p>The effect is instantaneous, and the subjects cannot voluntarily return to the Mundane Realm for 10 years, unless another being specifically summons them.

					<p><em class="spellname">Dolorous Itch</em> affects the epidermis of the subject creatures. Creatures with very thick or insensitive skins (such as scaled creatures) are unaffected. The wizard can choose one of two effects when the spell is cast:</p>

					<dl class="detailed">
						<dt>Virulent Boils</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This version of the spell can be cast at one creature only, with a Save penalty of -2. When <em>Boils</em> is cast, the subject notices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter its entire skin begins to break out in itching red buboes.</p>
							<p>It lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each of four days. After one week, Dexterity is also lowered by 1 point.</p>
							<p>The boils persist until either a <em class="spell priest">Cure Disease</em> or <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> is used. Symptoms vanish immediately upon the removal of the boils, and all attributes return to normal.</p>
						</dd>

							<p>This effect can be targeted on up to four enemies within range and the AOE. When cast, it causes each subject to feel an itching sensation on some portion of its body. </p>
							<p>Each can make a Save to resist the effect. If cast at one creature, the Save has a -3 penalty; if cast at two creatures, the Save has a -1 penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures, the Save is normal.</p>
							<p>If one round is not immediately spent scratching the irritated area, the creature must spend the next three rounds squirming and twisting, with a -2 To Hit and -3 AC penalty. Spellcasting is impossible in the first round, although not the later rounds. Doing nothing but scratching the itch for a full round prevents the rest of the effect.</p>

					<p>This spell must be cast on a sealable container of some sort. <em class="spellname">Dweomer's Vessel</em> prepares the container to receive another spell, and to hold it until the seal is broken.</p>

					<p>The size and composition of the <em class="spellname">Vessel</em> that must be used depend on the power of the spell to be placed within. A 1st lvl spell may be held in a simple leather pouch, a 2nd requires a pottery flask, 3rd level spells require a wooden box, and so on up to 6th level spells (the highest possible), requiring a heavy iron-bound cask. Any <em class="spellname">Vessel</em> must be sprinkled with powdered garnet, to a value of 10 gp / spell level it must hold.</p>

					<p>Once the <em class="spellname">Vessel</em> is ready, the second spell must be cast the following round. Only the mage who cast <em class="spellname">Dweomer's Vessel</em> may place spells within it. Once the second spell is cast, the container must be sealed immediately, or the magic will escape.</p>

					<p>While held within, there is a 5% chance each hour that the trapped spell will burst the <em class="spellname">Vessel</em> and take effect. Otherwise, it will remain until the duration expires, or until the seal is physically broken.</p>

					<p>Only one <em class="spellname">Dweomer's Vessel</em> may be cast on a single container at a time. If two or more <em class="spellname">Vessels</em> are within 30 ft. of each other, the magics of the containers will begin to clash, and the chance that each will spontaneously escape is increased by +5% each hour per additional container.</p>

					<p>Once a trapped spell is released, there is a further 3% chance / spell level that it will fade away without effect. Otherwise the magic will instantly affect the area around the <em class="spellname">Vessel</em>, as if at zero range. A touch-ranged spell can only affect a creature touching the <em class="spellname">Vessel</em> at the time.</p>

					<p>The caster cannot automatically dispel the <em class="spellname">Vessel</em>.</p>

					<p>When the duration of the <em class="spellname">Dweomer's Vessel</em> ends, the contained spell fades away and is gone. The container itself can be used again for another casting of the spell.</p>

Each member of <em class="spellname">The Throng</em> is a separate illusion, complete with realistic sounds of breathing and running footsteps, and each can be struck in combat as if AC 8.

					<p>Any <em>Charmed</em> creature regards the wearer of the <em class="spellname">Crown</em> as their master. If communication is possible, the creature follows reasonable requests, instructions, or orders faithfully.</p>

					<p>If two or more <em>Charms</em> simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new Saves that could negate both spells.</p>

			<h4>4th lvl Conjuration</h4>

				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>90 ft.</dd>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell summons several thick squamous <em class="spellname">Tentacles</em> into the AOE. These waving arms seem to spring forth from whatever surface is underfoot, writhing and thrashing mindlessly, trying to wrap around anything within reach.</p>

					<p>There are 1d4 <em class="spellname">Black Tentacles</em>, +1 / caster level. Each is 20 ft. long, and about a foot in diameter. Each attacks a random solid target of S size or larger within the AOE, possibly including the caster of the spell or nearby trees, pillars or the like.</p>

					<p>Any target of a <em class="spellname">Tentacle</em> can resist with a Save. If this succeeds, the subject suffers 1d4 HP damage from the <em class="spellname">Tentacle's</em> abrasive touch; but it then bursts apart into an unpleasant mass, and is destroyed.</p>

					<p>A failed Save inflicts 2d4 points, and means that the <em class="spellname">Black Tentacle</em> is wrapped around its subject. Each subsequent round its rasping grip will inflict another 2d4 damage. Once grabbed, the victim will not be attacked by another <em class="spellname">Tentacle</em>.</p>

					<p>A target grabbed by a <em class="spellname">Tentacle</em> cannot move, although if M-sized or smaller they will be thrown about as the thing coils and writhes. They have a penalty To Hit of -3, lose 2 AC and all Dex bonuses to AC, and must make a <em>Concentration</em> roll to cast spells.</p>

					<p>The grip of a <em class="spellname">Tentacle</em> can be broken with a Str vs Str 22 roll. Others can try to sever the limb; it has AC 4, and has 1 HP / caster level.</p>

					<p>Once entwined, the limbs never give up their grip, until destroyed. Even the death of a grabbed target will not cause a <em class="spellname">Black Tentacle</em> to let go.</p>

					<p>However, the death of the caster will cause the <em class="spellname">Tentacles</em> to retract, writhing feebly, soon vanishing entirely.</p>

					<p><em>Erlik</em>, creator of this spell, is unknown, bar some non-specific and unpleasant rumours.</p>

					<p>This spell requires a severed hand from a thinking being; the magic turns it into an illuminating object that reveals hidden things.</p>

					<p>Once complete, the fingers of the <em class="spellname">Corpse Candle</em> ignite, each burning like a wavering candle, and the whole gives off an unpleasant light equivalent to a torch, although cold. The caster can command the hand to float in place, up to 10 ft. from the ground, or accompany him, moving along at head height, up to 50 ft. away.</p>

					<p>The light of the <em class="spellname">Candle</em> will limn undead creatures within its area with a peculiar light, making their unliving status obvious. It also lingers upon and reveals creatures hiding through mundane means (e.g. in shadows, or beneath undergrowth) as well as <em class="spell">Invisible</em> creatures. It does not reach into the Ethereal Realm.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Corpse Candle</em> can be struck down by a blow (it has AC 6 and 3 HP) or destroyed by damaging spells.</p>

					<p>This spell allows the caster to establish a second viewpoint that hovers high above him, like a bird of prey. It is usually cast outdoors, as it requires at least 200 ft. of vertical space over the caster's head. The <em class="spellname">Falcon's Eye</em> moves with the caster.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Falcon's Eye</em> allows him to examine a wide circle around, in detail, as if he stood no more than six feet from any point. He can switch viewpoints to-and-from his own eyes at will for the duration of the spell, without confusion.</p>

					<p>The spell does not, however, grant any power to look through darkness or solid cover, so anything concealed under a roof remains invisible. Any kind of enhancement to the wizard's vision (such as <em class="spell">Cat's Eyes</em>) does not apply to the remote viewpoint.</p>

					<p>This powerful curse takes total possession of the victim's senses, plunging them into a complete imaginary world.</p>

					<p>The target cannot feel pain or discomfort from an outside source, and will eat and drink only if viands are components of the <em class="spellname">Delusion</em>, possibly starving to death.</p>

					<p>The fifth and later rounds of a casting of <em class="spell">Azaelin's Plundering Of The Mind</em> can be used by another wizard to witness the mental world that the target inhabits.</p>

					<p>The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast. Attunement to another individual requires a hank of hair, dram of blood, nail clippings, preserved spittle or beloved personal object.</p>

					<p>This spell is usually cast with an outstretched hand or pointing finger, sending a burning mote leaping away which, unless blocked, blossoms into a <em class="spellname">Fireball</em> at the caster's chosen destination. Anything solid which blocks the mote causes an early detonation.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Fireball</em> is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and inflicts 1d6 HP damage / caster level (up to a maximum of 10d6). A <em class="spellname">Fireball's</em> burst creates little pressure and generally conforms to the shape of its surroundings.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Fireball</em> can also ignite flammable materials, and melt soft metals such as gold, copper, and silver. Exposed items can Save to resist the heat. If carried by a creature that has itself Saved, items are not affected.</p>

Those within 5 feet must also Save or suffer 1d4 HP damage. The DM may adjust the Saves if there is little or no room to dodge the <em class="spellname">Globe</em>.

					<p>This spell makes an ordinary <em class="spellname">Fly</em> into a magical spy, able to transmit what it witnesses to the caster. The <em class="spellname">Fly</em> must begin within 5 ft. of the caster.</p>

					<p>The insect flies at 30 ft. / round, as controlled by the caster, who must maintain Minimal <em>Concentration</em> for the duration of the spell.</p>

					<p>Upon casting the spell on a living insect, the spell grants limited <em class="spell">Clairaudience</em> and <em class="spell">Clairvoyance</em>. The wizard can hear any noise within 10 ft. of the insect. <em class="spell">Clairvoyance</em> through the <em class="spellname">Fly</em>, however, is rather disorientating, and the wizard is at penalties of -2 To Hit and +2 to his AC while the spell functions, and for three rounds after it ends.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Fly On The Wall</em> may cause observed creatures to feel a nagging sense of being spied upon. The base chance of this happening is equal to the subject's Int as a percentage, modified as follows:</p>

					<dl class="complex-terms">

					<p><em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> may also reveal the <em class="spellname">Spider</em>.</p>

					<p>Certain magical barriers (e.g. <em class="spell">Globes Of Invulnerability</em>) sever the link between caster and insect, and the effect will be noticeable to a <em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magic</em> or <em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> that includes the insect in its AOE.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Fly</em> will transmit certain harmful effects to the caster. Any form of <em>blindness</em> effect or gaze attack (including <em>petrifaction</em>) aimed at the <em class="spellname">Fly</em> instead affects the wizard. Saves apply as usual. If the caster should be blinded while the spell remains, he can use the <em class="spellname">Fly On The Wall</em> to see.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the wizard to bestow the power of magical flight. The creature affected is able to move vertically and horizontally at a rate of 60 ft.  / round (half that if ascending, twice that if descending in a dive).</p>

					<p>The recipient of <em class="spellname">Flight</em> may cast spells and maintain Minimal <em>Concentration</em>, as long as their speed remains at 60 ft. / round or less.</p>

					<p>However, missile fire suffers a cumulative penalty of -1 To Hit / round, to a maximum of -4; a round spent recovering position will reduce the penalty back to -1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to cock a medium or heavy crossbow, or use certain other weapons, such as a sling. Melee attacks made while in flight may be delayed by the need to make a flying pass at enemies.</p>

					<p>This special flying spell is not cast on a creature, but upon an object. The enchanted object gains the power to fly up to 80 ft. / round under the caster's direction. A broom, chair, table, carpet, wagon, or hut could all be made capable of flight. The object moves clumsily, but can rise and fall by the command of the caster.</p>

					<p>The spell can affect an object of up to 25 lbs / caster level, and the object can carry four times that amount of weight in passengers or freight, assuming the object is large and strong enough to do so.</p>

					<p>The caster must maintain Minimal <em>Concentration</em> upon the <em class="spellname">Flying Chattel</em> to direct its motion and maintain its flight, else it will hover in mid air. If the caster is knocked unconscious, stunned, or slain while directing the <em class="spellname">Flying Chattel</em>, it will immediately begin to fall earthward.</p>

					<p>Smaller objects under the effect of a <em class="spellname">Flying Chattel</em>, such as a chair, may be difficult for a passenger to safely remain in. Any violent action (like receiving a blow in combat) will necessitate a Save vs. Dex, or the passenger will fall out. It may be useful to provide some means of securing a passenger to the object.</p>

					<p>Anyone attempting to leave the <em class="spellname">Fog Of Nightmares</em> must Save at -3 or become disorientated, stumbling back into it for another round. Those caught within the <em class="spellname">Fog</em> must Save or suffer feelings of dread and fear, suffering -2 To Hit and damage. </p>

					<p>There is a 3 in 4 chance each round that one of the creatures in the <em class="spellname">Fog</em> will be attacked by an illusory monster from their own imagination. 25% of the attacks will be from <em class="spell">Phantasmal Killers</em>, the remainder from a <em class="spell">Greater Shade</em> of HD equal to the caster's level (their form is chosen by the DM).</p>

					<p>Once a victim successfully defeats a monster or exits the <em class="spellname">Fog</em>, they are safe from that casting of the spell.</p>

					<p>The reaction of the called being depends on how important the reason for summoning it is, in the opinion of that creature:</p>

					<p>If the matter is trifling, the being might leave, inflict an appropriate penalty on the wizard, or attack them. If the matter is of middling importance, the being can take some positive action to set matters right, then demand appropriate repayment. If the matter is urgent, the being can act accordingly and ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if appropriate.</p>

					<p>The actions of the being that comes through depend on many factors, including the alignments of the wizard and the deity, the nature of his companions, and who or what opposes or threatens the wizard. Such beings generally avoid direct conflict with their equals or betters.</p>

					<p>This magic calls into being a weird barrier; a wall seemingly made of thousands of live, searching eyes, of all sizes from human to giant. Each eye restlessly rolls and darts in its orbit, seeking out all within view.</p>

					<p>The wall is always 3 ft. thick and at least 10 ft. high, but it can be shaped into a circle, a long rectangle, or any other configuration, up to the total AOE allowed.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Gazing Rampart</em> conveys the vision of these eyes to its creator, organising them into a coherent impression.  The caster is immediately made aware of anything visible that occurs within 100 ft. and line of sight of the wall, in any direction.</p>

					<p>The eyes are collectively able to spot <em>invisible</em> things and those hidden in shadows or the like, and can pierce mundane darkness. They also <em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magical</em> auras.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Rampart</em> also blocks physical access and attacks. It can be damaged or destroyed, however; 15 HP damage from any source will rupture the eyes across one 15 sq. ft section, and produce a hole large enough for a man to squeeze through.</p>

					<p>The wall will transmit certain harmful effects to the caster. Any form of <em>blindness</em> effect or gaze attack (including <em>petrifaction</em>) aimed at the <em class="spellname">Rampart</em> instead affects the wizard. Saves apply as usual.

					<p>This spell creates a tiny glowing mote, hot to the touch and giving off a low crackle, which the caster can drop or place as they wish, within 5 ft. Once there, the wizard must set the mote to explode, choosing a delay of from one to five rounds. It cannot then be moved.</p>

A successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> cast upon it will snuff it out and end the spell, but mundane efforts (such as pouring water over it) will not.</p>

A <em class="spell">Fireball's</em> burst creates little pressure and generally conforms to the shape of its surroundings.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spell">Fireball</em> can also ignite flammable materials, and melt soft metals such as gold, copper, and silver. Exposed items can Save to resist the heat. If carried by a creature that has itself Saved, items are not affected.</p>

					<p>This spell is a lesser version of <em class="spell">Invisibility</em>, one which can be granted to any willing creature by touch. The spell requires that the recipient hide his features for the duration; any kind of mask, bag, hood or item that entirely covers the face will suffice.</p>

					<p>While the spell is functioning, any foe who attempts to directly harm the recipient in any way must make a Save. A failure means that the enemy loses sight of them, and they will then remain hidden from the foe for the duration of the spell. Sightless enemies and the undead are not affected.</p>

					<p>However, those who fall under the effects of the spell can still sense the <em class="spellname">Hooded</em> creature, and will not lose track of their whereabouts. While they cannot directly attack the recipient, they can impede, block or herd them, and can make them the indirect target of area-effect attacks.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>This spell allows the caster to make contact with a being from another Realm in order to gain knowledge. Such beings are often of sinister and alien aspect; the majority dwell in forbidden and cruel Realms.</p>

					<p>The caster may ask a single question, and they always run the risk of their mind becoming infected with a creeping madness. The identity of the alien intelligence may not be known to the caster, and it will usually identify itself with a symbolic alias, such as '<em>the Grey Prince</em>', '<em>Maw Of Fear</em>', or the like.</p>

					<p>While casting and asking the question, the caster enters a kind of trance, during which time they cannot perceive the outside world, and may be vulnerable. Any injury sustained will break the contact and end the spell.</p>

					<p>The other-worldly being will resent the intrusion, and their answer to the wizard's question will be vague and brief.</p>

					<p>The answer brings with it a chance for madness; the caster must Save vs. Wisdom at a +3 bonus or lose their mind. If insanity strikes, the duration is determined by how much the roll was failed by:</p>

					<h5>Duration of madness by failed Save</h5>
					<dl class="simple">
						<dt>1-3</dt><dd>1 hour</dd>
						<dt>4-6</dt><dd>12 hours</dd>
						<dt>7-9</dt><dd>1 day</dd>
						<dt>10+</dt><dd>1 week</dd>
						<dt>Any roll of 2</dt><dd>1 month</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>The type of madness is usually a form of catatonia, paranoia, or intense megalomania. Alternatively, it might manifest as any other psychosis of the DM's choice. If insanity occurs, any remaining questions will be forgotten and the <em class="spellname">Grammerie</em> broken.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spell priest">Lift Curse</em>, <em class="spell">Remove Curse</em>, <em class="spell priest">Heal</em> or similar magic will cure the insanity.</p>

					<p>Targets who fail the Save are interred within the ground, each pinned by several of the grasping hands, unable to escape under their own power. They are buried about six feet down, where a <em class="spell">Detect Undead</em> might find them.

He can see through any <em>illusion</em> of 8th level or below, recognising them as false, and can see hidden or concealed objects and creatures, including those that are <em class="spell">Invisible</em> or in darkness. He can also see the true forms of <em class="spell">Shapeshifted</em> creatures, see magical auras, and look into neighbouring Realms, including the Realm Ethereal.</p>

					<p>Unlike <em class="spell">Second Sight</em>, this spell will also penetrate a <em class="spell">Prismatic Sphere</em> or <em class="spell">Wall</em>. It cannot, however, see a creature under the effects of <em class="spell">Walk Imperceptible</em>.</p>

					<p>This special and powerful spell is primarily used to defend the wizard's stronghold. The ward protects a one-story building, with a base size of 400 feet x 400 feet. The wizard can ward a multi-story building by reducing the base area proportionately.</p>

					<p>Upon casting the spell, the following effects take place in the warded area:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>All corridors become misty; normal visibility is reduced to 10 ft.</li>
						<li>All doors are <em class="spell">Wizard Locked</em>.</li>
						<li>Stairs are filled with <em class="spell">Webs</em> from top to bottom. These strands regrow within ten minutes if destroyed.</li>
						<li>Where there are choices in direction - such as a cross or side passage - a minor <em class="spell">Sow Confusion</em> effect makes it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction.</li>
						<li>The whole area radiates magic. Normal use of <em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magic</em> becomes impossible for those of less than the caster's level, and difficult for others.</li>
						<li>One door / caster level is covered by a <em class="spell">Phantasm</em>, to appear as if it were a plain wall.</li>
						<li>The wizard can place <em>one</em> of the following additional magical effects:
							<ul>
								<li><em class="spell">Dancing Lights</em> in four corridors.</li>
								<li><em class="spell">Gust Of Wind</em> in one corridor or room.</li>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Wind</em> is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It has a 10% chance / caster level to extinguish covered flames, and will fan large fires outward 1d6 ft. / round in the direction of the wind's movement.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Gust Of Wind</em> can also be used to give a sudden burst of speed to a small boat or ship with a sail (no larger than a Knarr).

					<p>This spell creates an illusion that hides the actual terrain within the AOE. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to look like a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to look like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Hallucinatory Terrain</em> looks, sounds, feels and smells appropriate to the chosen illusion, and can be walked on without the fakery being noticed, unless a traveller is injured by unseen terrain features. Any journey through it will be at the slowest rate for either the real or illusory ground.</p>

					<p>Jarring or unlikely changes in terrain may allow a passive chance to <em>Disbelieve</em>; in any case, a successful <em>Disbelieve</em> roll will allow an observer to see through the illusion.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>This magic is a powerful variant of the various <em>Hold</em> spells. It creates a mystical barbed chain, often ornate and baroque in appearance, which pins the targets' shadows, and so their bodies, to the spot. Any creature with a solid body can be affected, including many kinds of undead. The <em class="spellname">Howling Chain</em> gives off a unearthly, piercing wail, which often attracts attention across a wide area.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Hargyn's Howling Chain</em> affects the targets selected by the caster within the AOE. All affected can Save to resist, with a modifier as follows:</p>

					<dl class="simple">
						<dt>3-4 targets</dt><dd>All Saves at normal</dd>
						<dt>2 targets</dt><dd>Both Save at a -1 penalty</dd>
						<dt>1 target</dt><dd>Save at a -3 penalty</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>If it takes effect, a victim cannot move more than a single step for the spell's duration. Flying targets are pinned to the ground and cannot take wing. While chained, the targets suffer from -3 AC penalty and lose any Dex bonus to AC. They can only use melee weapons against those who come within reach, and at a -3 penalty, although they are able to use missile weapons and cast spells as usual.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Chain</em> can be <em class="spell">Dispelled</em>, but cannot be broken by force or damage of any kind. Any creature able to become incorporeal or enter the Ethereal Realm can use those methods to step out of the <em class="spellname">Howling Chain</em> and escape.</p>

					<p>This spell bars a door, gate, or other closeable entrance. The magical closure keeps the <em class="spellname">Portal</em> fast, just as if it were securely locked. It will not function on a lockable item, such as a chest or clasp, only a doorway or similar.</p>

					<p>The caster or a wizard 4 or more levels higher than the caster can open the <em class="spellname">Portal</em> with a touch; it will close again after they pass.</p>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell calls together a swarm or flock of small creatures (often rats or crows, but any single kind of small beast will do) to serve as spies for the caster.</p>

					<p>Once gathered, the little animals will disperse and roam at the limits of the spell, seeking out other creatures and attempting to observe them from concealment.</p>

					<p>The caster will instantly be able to see and hear any such creatures through the eyes and ears of the <em class="spellname">Host</em>, and can direct them to follow intruders with a thought. The animals will only remain within the AOE of the spell, which is immobile; if the caster leaves the area, the <em class="spellname">Host</em> will break apart.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Host Of Watchful Eyes</em> may cause observed creatures to feel a nagging sense of being spied upon. The base chance of this happening is equal to the subject's Int as a percentage, modified as follows:</p>

					<dl class="complex-terms">
						<dt>Each Level / HD</dt><dd>+10%</dd>
						<dt>Subject makes <em class="stored nwp">Animal Lore</em> roll</dt><dd>+20%</dd>
						<dt>Subject originates from another Realm</dt><dd>+25%</dd>
					</dl>

					<p><em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> may also reveal the <em class="spellname">Host Of Watchful Eyes</em>.</p>

					<p>Slaying or removing more than a handful of the creatures will cause the <em class="spellname">Host</em> to break apart, ending the spell; each animal has its usual defenses. Members of the <em class="spellname">Host</em> will not attack; they can be affected by spells such as <em class="spell priest">Charm Man Or Beast</em>, <em class="spell priest">Hold Animal</em>, etc. <em class="spell priest">Walk Amongst Beasts</em> will allow an intruder to entirely avoid being discovered by the creatures.</p>

					<p>This spell will transmit certain harmful effects to the caster. Any form of <em>blindness</em> effect or gaze attack (including <em>petrifaction</em>) aimed at members of the <em class="spellname">Host</em> instead affects the wizard. Saves apply as usual. If the caster should be blinded while the spell remains, he can use the <em class="spellname">Host Of Watchful Eyes</em> to see.</p>

					<p>With this spell, the wizard creates a glowing, rainbow-hued band of interweaving patterns. The caster need not utter a sound, but he must gesture appropriately.</p>

					<p>Any creature caught in it may become fascinated, and will gaze at it as long as the effect lasts. The spell can captivate a maximum of 24 levels / HD of creatures. Each is entitled to a Save.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Hues Of Fascination</em> will remain for as long as the caster maintains Minimal <em>Concentration</em>. If he loses concentration, the lights will remain static for 1d4+1 extra rounds, and then fade away.</p>

					<p>Alternatively, the wizard can make a simple gesture and the pattern of colours will drift slowly off in his chosen direction, followed by the onlookers, at a rate of 10 ft. / round. This ends the caster's concentration, and so the spell will persist for a further 1d4+1 rounds before ending.</p>

					<p>If the <em class="spellname">Hues Of Fascination</em> leads its subjects into obvious danger, each is allowed a second Save to break the spell.</p>

					<p>If a creature's view of the lights is blocked, the spell is immediately broken. Any injury sustained by an onlooker will also break the <em class="spellname">Fascination</em>.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the wizard to write magically powerful instructions. It requires a writing surface and some material with which to write or daub on it. The caster must know the names of his intended target(s), and include them in the text. Intended targets must be literate.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Imperative Script</em> appears to all readers to be some form of foreign or magical writing; only the named targets are able to decipher it easily.

					<p>If a named target glances at the <em class="spellname">Script</em>, they must make a Save. A success means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to the minor <em class="spell">Suggestion</em> implanted in the script.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spell">Suggestion</em> cannot require more than 30 minutes to carry out, and will never cause the target to act against their normal instincts. The command could be to close the book and leave, or to forget the existence of the book, for example.</p>

					<p>This spell summons an invisible and intangible creature whose purpose is to spy on a given being. After casting, the wizard has one hour to assign it a quarry within spell range, or else the <em class="spellname">Imp</em> vanishes again.</p>

					<p>Once given a target, the <em class="spellname">Imp Of Witness</em> remains with them at any distance and no matter how rapidly they move, silently reporting their actions and nearby sounds to the caster. Only the use of <em class="spell">Teleport</em>, <em class="spell">Dimension Door</em> or similar magics will allow the target to escape it.</p>

					<p>When followed by an <em class="spellname">Imp Of Witness</em>, a quarry will experience a constant nagging feeling of being watched, although the creature is entirely silent and invisible. A <em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magic</em> will reveal its presence, and any of the below spells will show its semblance; a small, smoky imp-like being with milky eyes:</p>

					<p>This spell is a powerful method of locating and tracking a target creature. It requires some scrap of the target's body (e.g a hank of hair, fingernails, phial of spittle or a dram of blood) and a map. Ideally the map should be as accurate as possible, because the casting assumes that the target is within the area depicted. If not, the spell fails.</p>

The scale and accuracy of the map, compared to the size of the fragment, will define how exact the positioning is. If the target should travel suddenly (e.g. via <em class="spell">Teleport</em>) the fragment will leap to match. If the target leaves the map, the fragment will stop at their last known position.</p>

					<p>This magic summons a tiny, bothersome winged insect to plague the victim. The <em class="spellname">Gnat</em> is no more than a black speck, but it produces an irritating buzz out of proportion to its size.</p>

					<p>Once conjured, the pest follows the caster's direction, circling incessantly around the victim's head, darting nimbly to and fro to try to remain out of reach. It is barred by an <em class="spell">Aura Of Protection</em> or similar ward.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Irksome Gnat</em> is highly distracting; the victim suffers a penalty of -1 on all rolls while it remains. While it stays, any attempt by the victim to cast a spell requires a <em>Concentration</em> roll, or else the spell is lost.</p>

					<p>The creature is very hard to swat with a normal blow; it has the equivalent of AC0 (AC4 to a lit torch or equivalent). Any successful hit will kill the insect.</p>

					<p>This spell only functions if a good quantity of ice or snow are present in the area around the caster. Casting <em class="spellname">Lance Of The Northern Wastes</em> causes it to begin to coalesce into a slim icy spear, which forms in mid-air in front of the caster.</p>

					<p>The Lance is vulnerable to physical and magical attack during the Casting Time, at AC 4 with 15 HP. Any heat applied will immediately melt the <em class="spellname">Lance</em> and end the spell.</p>

					<p>The next round the caster may direct the <em class="spellname">Lance</em> to fly at a target.

			<h3>Leathery Wings Of Illugi</h3>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell creates a pair of powerful giant bat wings, sprouting and unfolding to a 20 ft. span from the recipient's back. An unwilling recipient may resist the effect with a Save.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Leathery Wings</em> allow the user to fly somewhat clumsily but powerfully, at a rate of 50 ft. / round. The <em class="spellname">Wings</em> are able to lift twice their recipient's weight, or break the fall of three times their weight. Given room to move, they can buffet for 2d4 damage - attacks are made at the user's THACO.</p>

					<p>Using the <em class="spellname">Wings</em> requires as much concentration as walking, so most spells can be cast and maintained, as long as the recipient flies no faster than 30 ft. / round.</p>

					<p>However, missile fire suffers a cumulative penalty of -1 To Hit / round, to a maximum of -4; a round spent recovering position will reduce the penalty back to -1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to cock a medium or heavy crossbow, or use certain other weapons, such as a sling. Melee attacks made while in flight may be delayed by the need to make a flying pass at enemies.</p>

					<p>On the ground, the <em class="spellname">Wings</em> may be wrapped around the user and one other M sized creature to provide protection of AC 6, but this greatly impedes any form of movement; the pair can only shuffle along awkwardly.</p>

					<p>Otherwise, walking with <em class="spellname">Leathery Wings</em> is at 2/3rds normal rate; they may also be too large to fit in enclosed spaces.</p>

					<p>The creator of this spell was once High Magister of Tugersbir, before he left the role and vanished from society.</p>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell prepares a cut and engraved gemstone to contain magical energy. Preparation requires 1 uninterrupted day for each level of energy, during which time the gem must remain in the caster's possession, and no other spells cast. A mage may enchant a <em class="spellname">Lens</em> to hold a number of energy levels equal to half their caster level (round down).</p>

					<p>The energy levels that can be held within a <em class="spellname">Lens</em> are also limited by its value - 10gp for each.</p>

					<p>Gazing through a <em class="spellname">Lens Of Arcane Power</em> to use its energies adds 2 to a spell's Casting Time. It increases all of the spell's properties that rely on caster level, including the difficulty of Saves made by enemies. A spell can only be empowered by one <em class="spellname">Lens</em> at a time.</p>

					<p>The held energy need not be released all at once, but can be distributed between several spells over time, as needed by the user. The detailed engravings on the surface of the <em class="spellname">Lens</em> will fade and smooth out as the energies are used up.</p>

					<p>A finished <em class="spellname">Lens Of Power</em> will hold the energy until it is used or the <em class="spellname">Lens</em> is destroyed. A depleted <em class="spellname">Lens</em> can be re-charged with another casting of this spell.</p>

					<p>If a <em class="spellname">Lens Of Arcane Power</em> is destroyed, the trapped energy is released in a magical implosion, causing 1d4 damage / energy level to all within 10 ft. (Save halves damage). A <em class="spellname">Lens</em> is as resilient to damage as any mundane gemstone.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Lens</em> is subject to the effects of <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> and similar. If successful, the gem will become inert.</p>

					<p>Once created, a <em class="spellname">Lens Of Power</em> can be used by another wizard, and so they are often given to apprentices by their masters in time of need.</p>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell creates a pair of linked containers, one large and one small. The large <em class="spellname">Secret Chest</em> can be hidden in the Ethereal Realm and recalled via the smaller version.</p>

					<p>The large chest must be exceptionally well-made and expensive (never less than 50gp), constructed by master craftsmen, and usually measures 3 ft. x 4 ft. x 2 ft. Once it is finished, the wizard must have a tiny perfect replica made, of the same materials.</p>

					<p>The large <em class="spellname">Secret Chest</em> can further be protected with locks, traps or magical wards. This box can contain 1 cubic ft. of material / caster level, no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable inanimate objects.</p>

					<p>A wizard can own only one pair of matched chests at any given time.</p>

					<p>Once the pair of containers are complete, the caster speaks the long final incantation. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Realm. As long as the caster has the small <em class="spellname">Secret Chest</em>, he can recall the large one whenever he desires. This requires a few spoken words and 4 Initiative Counts.</p>

					<p>When the caster has completed his business, a further intoned phrase and 4 more Initiative Counts will send the large container back to its hiding place.</p>

					<p>Whenever the large <em class="spellname">Secret Chest</em> is brought back to the Mortal Realm, a window to the Ethereal Realm remains open for about 10 minutes. The portal slowly shrinks away, but in the meantime a denizen of the Ethereal Realm might possibly come through.</p>

					<p>While the large <em class="spellname">Secret Chest</em> is in the Ethereal Realm, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some being comes across it. This chance is reset to 1% when the chest is recalled.</p>

					<p>If the miniature chest is lost or destroyed, or 60 days go by without a recall, the large version will not return, although it might be possible to recover it by travelling in person.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the wizard to magically call into being a sturdy cottage or lodge, which assembles itself from material that is common in the area where the spell is cast - stone, timber, or sod.</p>

					<p>The floor area of the lodging is 30 square feet / caster level, and the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two or more shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.</p>

					<p>The inside of the <em class="spellname">Shelter</em> contains rude furnishings as desired by the caster - up to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, as many as four chairs or eight stools, and a writing desk.</p>

					<p>While the lodging is secure against winds of less than gale force, it has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise, as it is as strong and fire-resistant as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition.</p>

					<p>The door, shutters, and chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being <em class="spell">Wizard Locked</em> and the latter being secured by a top grate of iron and a narrow flue. All three areas are also protected by an <em class="spell">Alarum</em> spell.

					<p>An <em class="spell">Unseen Servant</em> is also conjured to provide service to the caster.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Bower</em> has a rudimentary door, and room inside for three man-sized creatures, if they huddle together. The others can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it, but if the caster dies or removes himself from the <em class="spellname">Bower</em>, it collapses into a formless heap.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Resolute Bower</em> maintains a comfortable temperature, even if the outside is freezing cold or in scorching sunshine, and provides protection against rain, dust, sandstorms, and the like. The <em class="spellname">Bower</em> can withstand any wind of less than storm force without being harmed, but winds greater than that will blow it apart.</p>

					<p>The interior of the <em class="spellname">Resolute Bower</em> can be illuminated dimly upon the caster's command, or he can extinguish the light as desired. The cover is opaque from the outside, although those within can peer out through cunning gaps.</p>

					<p>Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the <em class="spellname">Bower</em> without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside, and blind targeting of them is at a -3 To Hit penalty.</p>

					<p>If the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can move vertically up or down at a movement rate of 10 ft. per round, without needing to concentrate.</p>

					<p>If cast upon an object or another creature, the wizard can <em class="spellname">Levitate</em> it at the same speed, according to his command. <em class="spellname">Levitating</em> another target requires Minimal <em>Concentration</em> to be maintained by the caster.</p>

					<p>This spell does not empower horizontal movement, but the recipient could slowly drag themselves by hand along the face of a cliff, for example.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Levitating</em> creature attempting to use missile fire suffers a cumulative penalty of -1 To Hit / round, to a maximum of -4; a round spent recovering position will reduce the penalty back to -1.

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The <em class="spellname">Magic Jar</em> spell enables the caster to shift his spirit into a special receptacle (a sapphire of at least 200gp value or more). From there the caster can force an exchange of souls between the <em class="spellname">Jar</em> and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to possess the target's body, while the target's spirit is confined in the gem.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Jar</em> must be within spell range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. Once complete, the caster's body lies inert, appearing to be in a very deep sleep.</p>

					<p>While in the <em class="spellname">Magic Jar</em>, the caster can sense and try to possess any living creature within a radius of 10 ft. / caster level of the gem; however, exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. Between a group of creatures, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels / HD.</p>

					<p>This spell will also fail (and the caster will understand why) if the the intended recipient has pledged their soul to another.</p>

					<p>An attempt to possess a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by <em class="spell">Aura Of Protection</em> or a similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a Save with a special modifier (see following):</p>

					<p>The Save is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard. This modifier is added to (or subtracted from) the die roll.</p>

					<h5>Save Modifier</h5>
					<dl class="simple">
						<dt>-6 or less</dt><dd>+3</dd>
						<dt>-5 to -3</dt><dd>+2</dd>
						<dt>-2 to 0</dt><dd>+1</dd>

						<dt>+5 to +8</dt><dd>-1</dd>
						<dt>+9 to +12</dt><dd>-2</dd>
						<dt>+13 or more</dt><dd>-3</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>Failure to possess the host leaves the wizard's spirit in the <em class="spellname">Magic Jar</em>.</p>

					<p>If successful, the caster's spirit occupies the host body and the host's spirit is confined in the <em class="spellname">Magic Jar</em>. A held soul cannot escape the gem or try to possess another creature.</p>

					<p>The caster retains his own THACO, class abilities, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is man-shaped, and necessary components are available, the wizard can use his memorised spells. The host body retains its own HP and physical abilities. The DM decides if any clumsiness results, should the new form be very different.</p>

					<p>The caster can shift from a host back to the <em class="spellname">Jar</em> if within range, returning the pent-up soul to its body. This requires one round, and afterwards the caster can try to possess another target. The spell ends when the wizard shifts back from the <em class="spellname">Jar</em> to his own body.</p>

					<p>If the host body is slain and the <em class="spellname">Jar</em> is within range, the caster returns to the receptacle and the host spirit is lost. If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, the caster dies and the host's spirit is ejected from the <em class="spellname">Jar</em>, to become lost.</p>

					<p>If the body of the caster is slain, his spirit can survive in either the receptacle or the host body.</p>

					<p>A successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> cast on an occupied host can drive the caster back into the <em class="spellname">Magic Jar</em> and prevent him from making any more attempts to possess, for 1d4 rounds + 1 round / caster level of the <em>Dispel</em>.</p>

					<p>If the <em class="spellname">Jar</em> is destroyed or ruined by <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em> while a spirit occupies it, that spirit is lost. The receptacle cannot be affected by a <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em>.</p>

					<p>A lost spirit of either caster or host may become a <em>Ghost</em>. They can be recalled by a <em class="spell priest">Resurrection</em> or similar.</p>

					<p>This magic calls upon a virulent dark power, and concentrates it within a single arrowhead. This is targeted upon a single named individual, whom it will slay on a successful hit. The target must be a living creature, native to the Mortal Realm. The weapon can only be used during the next night, and its powers fade at dawn.</p>

					<p>The arrowhead must be knapped from flint, bound in henbane root, and carved with a sigil containing the name of the target. It can then be attached to any unenchanted shaft and used in battle. A caster may only have one <em class="spellname">Malefic Dart</em> in existence at a given time.</p>

					<p>When fired, the <em class="spellname">Dart</em> strikes at normal chances To Hit, unless the target's <em>True Name</em> has been inscribed on it, which grants a +3 bonus. The arrow may be fired from a magical bow, but cannot itself bear another enchantment.</p>

					<p>A successful hit will slay the target. If it misses, and the arrow can be retrieved, it can re-enchanted the next night as another <em class="spellname">Malefic Dart</em>, which must target the same foe.</p>

					<p>This spell is believed to rely on forces summoned from the Infernal Realms.</p>

					<p>In order to cast this spell, the mage must burn a small fragment of the intended victim's body (a nail clipping or lock of hair suffices) and make stabbing motions for the duration of the magic. The fragment will be gone by the end of the spell duration.</p>

					<p>The victim of this conjuration, if within range, is visited by a disembodied inhuman hand clutching a barbed dagger, which attacks him immediately. It strikes once / round, using its caster's THACO, for 1d8+1 damage.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">The Clutch</em> moves with its victim, following inexorably. This will occur even if the victim <em>Teleports</em> or uses other magics, as long as he remains within range.</p>

					<p>It may be struck in combat by damaging spells, an enchanted or <em class="spell priest">Blessed</em> weapon as if AC 5, with HP equal to its caster's. A <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> can also remove it.</p>

					<p>When <em class="spellname">Manifold Effigies</em> is invoked, the caster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being.</p>

					<p>The number of images created is 1d4, +1 / three caster levels, to a maximum of eight. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which the actual wizard.</p>

					<p>When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images seem to shift and whirl from round to round, so that if the actual wizard is struck during one round, he cannot be picked out from among his images the next.</p>

			<h3>Many Eyes Of The Spider</h3>
			<h4>1st lvl Divination, Enchantment</h4>

				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>3 minutes</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>5 ft.; see below</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>10 minutes / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>By means of this spell, a wizard can temporarily see through the eyes of any living arachnid, which must begin within 5 ft. of the caster. Small, harmless, living spiders are usually employed, the caster using them as spies to see things where the caster dare not go.</p>

					<p>If the creature is mundane and normal-sized, this spell also gives the caster simple control over it, and so they can choose to have the spider move around, hide and so on, as they mentally direct.</p>

					<p>Occasionally this spell is cast on a giant spider (a successful hit is required if the spider is hostile and not surprised) to see through its eyes while battling it, so that its opponents can take advantage of striking from a blind spot. This kind of target does not fall under the caster's control.</p>

					<p>Most spiders have eight simple eyes whose vision is readily understandable to most intelligent races. The sight afforded by the spell includes the natural <em>Night Vision</em> of the spider, and lasts as long as the spell duration, no matter how far the arachnid travels. The caster cannot continue to see through the spider's eyes if either arachnid or caster move to another Realm of Existence, including the Ethereal.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Many Eyes Of The Spider</em> may cause observed creatures to feel a nagging sense of being spied upon. The base chance of this happening is equal to the subject's Int as a percentage, modified as follows:</p>

					<dl class="complex-terms">
						<dt>Subject's Level or HD</dt><dd>+10%</dd>
						<dt>Subject makes <em class="stored nwp">Animal Lore</em> roll</dt><dd>+20%</dd>
						<dt>Subject originates from another Realm</dt><dd>+25%</dd>
					</dl>

					<p><em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> may also reveal the <em class="spellname">Spider</em>.</p>

					<p>Certain magical barriers (e.g. <em class="spell">Globes Of Invulnerability</em>) can sever the link between caster and spider, and the effect will be noticeable to a <em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magic</em> or <em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> spell that includes the spider in its AOE.</p>

					<p>This spell will transmit certain harmful effects to the caster. Any form of <em>blindness</em> effect or gaze attack (including <em>petrifaction</em>) aimed at the <em class="spellname">Spider</em> instead affects the wizard. Saves apply as usual. If the caster should be blinded while the spell remains, he can use the <em class="spellname">Many Eyes Of The Spider</em> to see.</p>

					<p>This magic places an invisible, unique mark upon a creature. A creature is entitled to a Save to avoid the <em class="spellname">Mark</em>, although the target will usually be unaware that any spell has been attempted.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Mark</em> is visible only to the caster and creatures he touches during casting (up to seven M-sized creatures could do so). It can also be seen via <em class="spell">Second Sight</em>, <em class="spell priest">Reveal</em> and the like.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Mark</em> shows through clothing and disguises to those who can see it, even in dim light or through magical transformations. In this way, a marked person can be readily distinguished in a crowd. It radiates magic, and can also detected in that manner.</p>

					<p>A given caster's <em class="spellname">Mark</em> is recognisably his; the same symbol or glyph he uses as a <em class="spell">Wizard's Sigil</em>, and those familiar with it may be able to identify the caster.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Mark</em> fades away when the spell ends, or can be removed by <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em>, <em class="spell priest">Lift Curse</em> or <em class="spell">Remove Curse</em>.</p>

					<p>This powerful magic is an improved version of <em class="spell">Magic Mirror</em>, and operates in a similar way. It allows the caster to first scry on, and then make contact with, a far distant creature or place, by peering through the Astral Realm.</p>

					<p>Like <em class="spell">Magic Mirror</em>, it requires a looking glass of finely wrought and highly polished silver that costs at least 100 gp.</p>

					<p>The chance of success is as shown below. Any failure prevents a second attempt upon the same subject or location for 1 day.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Looking Glass</em> cannot locate a creature under <em class="spell">Forlorn Encystment</em>.</p>

					<p>A successful roll allows the caster to both see and hear the creature or location, from a fixed point of view. This point of view is usually 8 ft. in the air, tilted downwards, but can appear at any height off the ground if the caster desires.</p>

					<p>Once established, the following spells can be easily cast via the <em class="spellname">Looking Glass</em>:</p>

						<li><em class="spell">Comprehend Language</em></li>

					<p><em class="spellname">Marvellous Looking Glass</em> also allows the caster to plunge his hands through the mirror and make contact with the target.</p>

					<p>He can strike with a one-handed weapon, try to strangle a creature, or grab and bring back any small object that will fit within his grasp. He can only reach out to his arms' length from the fixed viewpoint of the mirror, which may be easy for a target to avoid.</p>

					<p>The caster cannot use a touch spell or cast spells while his hands are through the <em class="spellname">Looking Glass</em>, and will take appropriate damage from any injury to his hands or arms. The caster can pull his hands back to safety as a movement action, and try again on subsequent rounds.</p>

					<p>Reversed missiles include thrown axes, arrows, bolts, spears, javelins and the like, as long as neither bow nor projectile are magical. The attacker must make an attack roll against themselves, with all normal bonuses To Hit, and inflicts damage as usual.</p>

					<p>Magical projectiles and heavier missiles (such as thrown boulders, ballista bolts and the like) are not reversed, but are slowed by <em class="spellname">Mastery Of Missiles</em>, and lose 2 points per damage die (minimum 1/die).</p>

					<p>With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of any animate or inanimate thing he can think of.</p>

					<p>If the caster becomes a creature, he has all of its abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical abilities, and <em>Magic Resistance</em>. He will have the appropriate AC, movement and attacks, but retains the HP he had at the time of casting. If he has enough mobility and speech, he will keep his own spellcasting abilities.</p>

					<p>If the wizard changes into an inanimate object, he will have appropriate toughness or vulnerabilities; again, he retains the HP he had when casting the spell.</p>

					<p>The caster can further change his form once a round for the duration of the spell; no System Shock roll is needed.</p>

					<p>This spell cannot change the appearance of the caster's shadow. If examined, it will show their normal shape.</p>

					<p>An adopted shape can be detected as magical; the spell can be ended via <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em>.</p>

					<p>Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.</p>

					<p>The creature can move across a fluid as well as a solid surface, but the movement is reduced to half the creature's normal walking rate, as the creature must step carefully. <em class="spellname">Light Step</em> will not enable a creature to walk across turbulent water or ocean waves, however, as it requires a relatively flat surface. The surface comes into contact with the recipient's feet, and any effects from touching it will apply.</p>

					<p>This spell creates an unseen encirclement, which the caster can attempt to drop around a target creature to force them to move as he wishes. A Save is allowed to avoid the effect, in which case the spell collapses in on itself and is gone.</p>

					<p>Otherwise, the target becomes aware of a faint susurrus and scrabbling at the margins of their person, showing the presence of the <em class="spellname">Harness</em>.</p>

					<p>Each round thereafter the caster can attempt to force the victim to move. The victim must travel in the caster's chosen direction at a rate of 10 ft. / round (or their maximum rate, if it is less). If they choose not to move with the <em class="spellname">Harness</em>, they suffer the consequences.</p>

					<p>These manifest as hundreds of invisible but viciously sharp imp-like claws and teeth, which swarm over the victim, tearing and biting at their skin. This causes 2d4 damage each round that the victim refuses to move as the wizard dictates; a target who continues to do so will find that the <em class="spellname">Harness</em> travels with them, up to a maximum range of 100 ft. from the caster.</p>

					<p>Victims of a <em class="spellname">Flaying Harness</em> usually lose strips of skin, and bear long, livid marks on their flesh.</p>

					<p>A victim can be freed by them moving more than 100 ft. away, by the death of the caster, or by moving <em>Ethereally</em>, via <em class="spell">Dimension Door</em> or similar.</p>

					<p>This spell is similar to <em class="spell">Chamber Long Vacant</em>, only more powerful and elaborate. The spell enables the caster to make an locale appear to be something other than it is.</p>

					<p>The area will appear to be uninhabited, any real occupants being hidden, but will otherwise look, sound, smell and feel as determined by the caster. If the <em class="spellname">Mirage</em> includes harmful effects (such as a lit fire), it can cause injury to those who touch it. All such damage is <em>Subdual</em> Damage, which heals quickly and cannot kill. At the most, injuries from a <em class="spellname">Mirage Arcana</em> may render a target unconscious.</p>

					<p>The spell continues as long as the caster maintains Minimal <em>Concentration</em> and remains within range. Even after this, the spell persists for a total of one hour plus 10 minutes / caster level.</p>

					<p>Unlikely or poorly-imagined <em class="spellname">Mirages</em> (perhaps created without prior knowledge of the subject) may grant a passive attempt to <em>Disbelieve</em>. In any case, a successful <em>Disbelief</em> attempt will let an observer see through the fakery, and mean that they cannot be injured by it. Any previous injury sustained, once a <em>Disbelief</em> is successful, will immediately fade away.</p>

					<p>When this spell is cast, arcane magic and magical items within the AOE may be <em>disjoined</em>, except those being carried or touched by the caster.</p>

					<p>This spell cannot affect spells or items of a divine nature. Arcane magics are affected as follows:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Each spell effect must make a Save at their caster's level against the caster level of the <em class="spellname">Disjunction</em>. This includes a <em class="spell">Prismatic Sphere</em> or <em class="spell">Puissant Domain Against Sorcery</em> - if it survives, no items or spells within it are <em>disjoined</em>.</li>
						<li>Creatures summoned via arcane magic can be sent back whence they came; they can Save to avoid the effect.</li>
						<li>Magic items within the AOE must successfully Save or be permanently un-enchanted.</li>

					<p>By means of this spell, the wizard conjures, as if from thin air, a huge other-worldly dwelling with a single doorway. The doorway is mostly invisible, being only a faint shimmering unless the caster wishes otherwise. Only the caster may open and close the entrance, needing but a thought. <em class="spell">Detect Invisibility</em> or similar magic can reveal the doorway, but no power can force the <em class="spellname">Mansion</em> to open.</p>

					<p>Once creatures have passed beyond the entrance, they behold a magnificent foyer and numerous lavishly-appointed chambers beyond. The place is elegantly furnished, and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to as many dozens of people as the caster has levels of experience. Luxurious bedrooms and the like abound, and there is a staff of ghostly servants, liveried and obedient, to wait upon all who enter.</p>

					<p>The atmosphere within is clean, fresh, and warm; it remains separate from external conditions. The elaborate windows of the outermost chambers look out upon a hazy, almost formless dreamscape, although they cannot be used to exit the <em class="spellname">Mansion</em>.</p>

					<p>Anyone within the <em class="spellname">Mansion</em> is free to leave via the doorway, returning to the Mundane Realm. No offensive actions, spellcasting or the like can take place within; anyone who attempts such will be immediately and unceremoniously ejected by the <em class="spellname">Mansion</em>'s servants.</p>

					<p>Rest and relaxation within is normal, but the food and drink are not. It seems excellent and quite filling as long as one is within the place. Once outside, however, its effects disappear immediately, and the guests will feel appropriate hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p>If the caster exits the <em class="spellname">Mansion</em>, or when the spell duration is up, it will fade away to nothingness within moments, returning all still within to the Mundane Realm.</p>

			<h3>Mordenkainen's Sleep Of Ages</h3>
			<h4>9th lvl Enchantment</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>10 minutes</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>10 ft. radius / caster level; see below</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>Permanent; see below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This powerful magic creates an unseen enchantment that moves outwards from the caster's position, causing those within it to fall into a deep and deathly sleep.</p>

					<p>When casting <em class="spellname">Sleep Of Ages</em>, the wizard must stand within an unbroken sigil, drawn in a mixture of his own blood and powdered silver. Into this ring are placed several sprigs of lavender and one or more 100gp value moonstones.</p>

					<p>Once the spell is complete, a zone of enchantment begins to move outwards at 10 ft. / round, through physical and most magical barriers, until it reaches its maximum AOE.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spell">Puissant Domain Against Sorcery</em>, <em class="spell">Prismatic Wall</em>, or <em class="spell">Prismatic Sphere</em> will block an oncoming <em class="spellname">Sleep Of Ages</em> from its AOE. Otherwise, all creatures caught within will pass into an enchanted slumber. Only victims who normally require sleep can be affected. Once the spell reaches its full radius, the effect fades away, and will not cause later intruders to fall asleep. The caster may then step out of the sigil without undue harm.</p>

					<p>Affected creatures no longer require air, food or water, nor will they grow older as the years pass. They cannot be woken, even by being injured; only a successful <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em> can end the <em class="spellname">Sleep</em>. If a creature in a <em class="spellname">Sleep Of Ages</em> is slain its corpse will decay, as it suddenly regains its true age.</p>

					<p>The moonstones at the centre of the spell maintain the <em class="spellname">Sleep Of Ages</em>, losing lustre and crumbling slowly to worthless dust as the years pass. Each 10 gp of value lasts for 1 year of slumber. Once there are no gems remaining the spell ends and its victims awaken, but the duration may be extended by later placing more 100gp stones into the ring, potentially without limit.</p>

					<p>The moonstones can, however, be removed by a later intruder, ending the <em class="spellname">Sleep Of Ages</em> for all its victims. Because of this, a diligent caster may choose to secure the centre of the effect with spells and other defenses.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This powerful spell allows the caster to take control of the bodies of man-sized or smaller humanoids within the AOE, letting him choose their every action. It does not function on the undead, golems, or other-worldly creatures.</p>

					<p>The maximum number of targets is one / caster level; the caster can choose which beings within the AOE he can try to <em class="spellname">Puppet</em>. Each gets a Save to avoid the effect.</p>

					<p>Those who succumb to <em class="spellname">Mortal Puppets</em> will find that they have no power over their own bodies, except that they can still speak, in a muffled, stilted manner. The wizard is able to cause them to attack whoever he wishes, fall to the ground, walk or run in any direction, and so on. If he needs them to perform physical actions, their THACO is the same as the caster's, and their Dex is equal to his Int. The caster cannot force them to cast spells or use magical abilities, nor can he make them speak.</p>

					<p>While controlling his victims, the caster must maintain Full <em>Concentration</em>, and the victims must remain within the AOE. Otherwise, the target will be freed; they will need a round of inaction to recover, and will then be able to act normally again.</p>

					<p>An <em class="spell">Aura Of Protection</em> or similar will not block this spell, although a <em class="spell">Puissant Domain Against Sorcery</em>, <em class="spell">Unassailable Fortress Of The Mind</em> and various <em>Prismatic</em> defenses will do so.</p>

					<p>This powerful abjuration causes arcane spells cast against the wizard to rebound on the original caster. By tradition, it appears as a shimmering, iridescent cloak of Astral colours, shedding fragments of fading light.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Cloak</em> will reflect spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but cannot affect the following:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Any kind of priestly magic</li>
						<li>Area effect spells</li>
						<li>Spell effects delivered by touch</li>
						<li>Spell effects from devices such as wands, staves and the like</li>
					</ul>

					<p>A total of 2d4+4 spell levels can be affected. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM. The wizard cannot choose not to turn back a given spell; all viable incoming spells are automatically affected. The reflection takes place before any Save is rolled.</p>

					<p>A spell may be only partially affected - divide the number of remaining levels by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect is affected, with the remainder affecting the caster.</p>

					<p>If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have <em class="spellname">Moth-Wing Cloaks</em> operating, a resonance is created that has the following effect (roll d100):</p>

					<dl class="diceroll">

				<dd>
					<p>This fearsome spell propels the victim violently upwards, to either impact against whatever solid surface is in the way, or else to soar up to a height chosen by the caster, even into the clouds.</p>

					<p>If the target strikes a hard surface, they suffer 1d6 damage for each 10 ft. they have travelled, then plummet back to earth, usually sustaining more injury. Otherwise they will continue moving up at a rate of 100 ft. / round. While moving, they will be unable to cast spells, but may be able to attack others within reach, or take other actions.</p>

					<p>If nothing interposes itself, the victim will eventually reach a height of the caster's choice, to a maximum of 500 ft. There they will remain, pinned immediately above the spot they once stood upon. Once in place, they can cast spells again or otherwise act, but cannot move, unless naturally able to fly.</p>

					<p>Missile fire from a victim of <em class="spellname">Nailed To The Sky</em> suffers a cumulative penalty of -1 To Hit / round, to a maximum of -4; a round spent recovering position will reduce the penalty back to -1. Lack of leverage makes it impossible to cock a medium or heavy crossbow, or use certain other weapons, such as a sling.</p>

					<p>While <em class="spellname">Nailed To The Sky</em>, a man-sized creature can be very hard to spot from the ground; a Perception roll is required, at -1 per 100 ft. altitude. The spell can be <em>Dispelled</em> or <em class="spell">Disjuncted</em>, or the victim can be brought back to the ground via <em class="spell">Levitate</em>, <em class="spell">Flight</em>, or a flying creature that can pull with a Str of 16+.</p>

					<p>Unless rescued or able to escape themselves, the victim will slowly dehydrate and starve to death, eventually becoming nothing more than dry rags, shifting gently in the wind. Creatures that do not need to eat and drink will remain <em class="spellname">Nailed</em> forever.</p>

					<p>This spell has sometimes been referred to as <em class="spellname">The Tyranny Of Distance</em>.</p>

					<p>The globe must be about two inches in diameter, made of a <em>True Metal</em> (usually <em>True Silver</em>), and be valued at least 50 gp / spell level it can contain. It will bear ornate runes, sigils or other engravings which denote its power. During the Casting Time it must be kept close to the caster, and he must not use another spell during this period, or else the <em>weave</em> becomes tangled and useless.</p>

					<p>Once the <em class="spellname">Orb</em> is ready, it becomes warm to the touch. The caster may then cast spells into the <em>weave</em>, which catches them and keeps them dormant. The total number of spell levels held in a <em>spellweave</em> cannot exceed half the caster's level, and only 5th level spells and below can be kept there.</p>

					<p>A single command word of the caster's choice is used to activate the <em class="spellname">Orb</em> - only the original caster may do so, and they must be holding the <em class="spellname">Orb</em> at the time. Once the command is spoken, the <em>spellweave</em> unravels, and the spells it contains are cast one by one, in their original order and at their usual Casting Times. Several spells may be cast in a single round by a <em class="spellname">Spell-Weaver Orb</em>.</p>

					<p>An <em class="spellname">Orb Of The Spellweaver</em> may not be used to cast spells that require <em>Concentration</em>, nor spells that take up a permanent slot in the caster's memory. Casting touch-delivered spells will require a touch with the <em class="spellname">Orb</em>.</p>

					<p>If the <em class="spellname">Orb</em> is destroyed before the <em>weave</em> is entirely unravelled, the remaining energy is released in a burst that inflicts 1d10 damage per remaining spell level to all creatures within 10 ft. Once empty, the globe crumbles into worthless dust.</p>

					<p>While an <em class="spellname">Orb Of The Spellweaver</em> exists, its creator must dedicate a spell slot to it. The caster can always choose to end the effect, which returns the metal globe to its unenchanted state.</p>

				<dd>
					<p><em class="spellname">Paramount Gaze</em> enables the caster to meet the eyes of a creature and intone a single word to cause a powerful effect.<p>

					<p>The power in the wizard's <em class="spellname">Gaze</em> can be used once / round for the duration of the spell. In later rounds, after the first, the caster can move and take other non-combat actions in addition to making a <em class="spellname">Gaze</em> attack, but cannot cast other spells.</p>

					<p>This spell does not affect sightless creatures, undead of any type, or extend beyond the Realm occupied by the caster.</p>

					<p>The wizard selects one of four possible effects at the time the spell is cast, and this effect cannot be changed in later rounds. Any <em class="spellname">Gaze</em> is negated by a successful Save. The four possible effects of the spell are as follows:</p>

					<dl class="detailed">
						<dt>Agony</dt>
						<dd>This <em class="spellname">Gaze</em> causes sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. The victim suffers a penalty of -3 on all rolls, and moves at half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for 10 minutes / caster level. The effects cannot be negated by healing spells, but a <em class="spell priest">Lift Curse</em>, <em class="spell">Remove Curse</em> or a successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> will be effective. Non-humanoid creatures Save with +2 bonuses.</dd>
						<dt>Dominion</dt>
						<dd>This <em class="spellname">Gaze</em> allows the wizard to <em>charm</em> a single person or monster. The victim becomes absolutely loyal to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. Non-humanoid creatures Save with +2 bonuses. The effect lasts for 3d6 hours.</dd>
						<dt>Terror</dt>
						<dd>This <em class="spellname">Gaze</em> causes the subject to flee in blind terror for 3d4 rounds. After this the creature refuses to face the caster, and if subsequently confronted by them either cowers, or bolts for the nearest cover (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts 10 minutes / caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.</dd>
						<dt>Torpor</dt>
						<dd>This <em class="spellname">Gaze</em> causes the target to fall into a comatose slumber, unless the subject successfully Saves. Only targets who normally require sleep can be affected. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness; otherwise they will sleep for 1d6 hours.</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>This magic is believed to have its origins in an ancient inhuman power, from whom the sorcerors of the First Kingdom learned.</p>

					<p>This spell cloaks the caster in a retributive shield, which usually manifests as an enveloping aura of crackling light, dimly illuminating their surroundings, as does a lit match.</p>

					<p>This spell can be cast in one of two forms: a flaming <em class="spellname">Pelerine</em> that protects against cold-based attacks, or a chill <em class="spellname">Pelerine</em> that protects against fire-based attacks. The wizard must choose which variation he memorises when the spell is selected.</p>

					<p>Creatures striking the caster with its body or hand-held weapons inflict normal damage upon the wizard, but the attacker will also suffer injury as the aura flows back along their weapon. Base damage is 1d4 / caster level (possibly increased if the attacker is vulnerable to heat or cold).</p>

					<p>Additionally, the <em class="spellname">Pelerine</em> helps the caster resist injury, as follows:</p>

			<h3>Pentacle, Great</h3>

				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>Up to 1 year / caster level; see below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd class="truename">Negates; see below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>To cast this spell is to attempt a dangerous act: luring a powerful creature from another Realm to a prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform a service. The type of creature to be snared must be known and stated during the casting.</p>

					<p>The spell requires the caster to have already created the restraining ward. The ward can occupy an area of at least 10 ft. x 10 ft., to a maximum of 30 ft. x 30 ft., and cannot be interrupted by any kind of solid object.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Great Pentacle</em> opens a portal within the Realm of the target creature, and brings it to their attention. They can resist the summons with a Save, modified if the caster uses their <em>True Name</em>.</p>

					<p>If the Save succeeds, the creature ignores the opening, and the spell fails. If it succeeds by 6 or more, they may learn of the identity of the would-be trapper, and later exact retribution. If the Save fails, the creature steps into the opening and is drawn into the <em class="spellname">Pentacle</em>.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Great Pentacle</em> may also fail at the moment of arrival of its occupant; the chance is as follows:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A hand-drawn <em class="spellname">Pentacle</em> using mundane chalk, paint or the like takes 10 minutes to create, and has a base chance of failure of 20%. If it is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments, the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every extra hour. This can bring the base chance to 5%; the minimum for a hand-drawn ward. The rare and expensive pigments cost 10gp per extra hour spent drawing.</li>

						<li>An inlaid or carved design will require one week of work by the caster and cost 100gp, with a base chance of failure of 10%. It can be improved by using inlays of onyx and True Lead, and oils of angelica and garlic. Each 1% improvement will cost an additional 50gp and require an additional week of work. This can bring the base chance of failure to 0.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Pentacle</em> that fails has no power over its intended victim.</p>

					<p>A being caught in a <em class="spellname">Great Pentacle</em> cannot pass through its lines, nor use magic or other supernatural abilities on anything outside it. It will be able to throw missiles across the ward, so by tradition the inside of the <em class="spellname">Pentacle</em> is kept bare of objects.</p>

					<p>Only the summoner can enter the <em class="spellname">Pentacle</em> without breaking it. Any other interruption of the ward will render it useless - this includes creatures entering the bounded regions, a straw laid across the lines, or an object thrown into the area from outside.</p>

					<p>Once safely trapped, the caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature. It will usually resist such a service, with a score that begins as being equal to its Wisdom +3. This score drops by 1 for each month that the captive remains within the <em class="spellname">Pentacle</em>.</p>

					<p>The DM will assign a value to what the wizard has said to the trapped creature, rating it from 0 to 5 (with 5 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the resistance score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful 2d10 check against this score, it refuses the service. New offers can be made, or the old ones offered again, once each month.</p>

					<p>However, a creature will never agree to an impossible or completely unreasonable demand.</p>

					<p>This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, until the duration expires, or until the caster decides to free it.</p>

					<p>Once a single service is completed, the creature only needs to inform the caster to be instantly returned whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge.</p>

					<p>If a captive is freed by the caster without completing a service, it will immediately be able to attack, flee or perform any action it wishes.</p>

					<p>Instead of bargaining with the captive, the caster can choose to use <em class="spell">The Spell Of Binding</em> to doubly imprison it. Breaking the <em class="spellname">Binding</em> does not necessarily free the subject from the <em class="spellname">Great Pentacle</em>; the combined results will depend on the method of <em class="spellname">Binding</em> used.</p>

Other applications may be possible, but researching such will take time and effort; see below.</p>

					<p>A successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> cast upon a spell made <em class="spellname">Permanent</em> will suppress the effect for 2d6 rounds. A <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em> will remove both the spell and the <em class="spellname">Permanency</em>.</p>

					<p>The DM <em>may</em> allow other spells to be made <em class="spellname">Permanent</em>. Researching this possible application costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell itself.</p>

					<p>Each spell made <em class="spellname">Permanent</em> ages the caster by 5% of their usual lifespan.</p>

					<p>Using <em class="spellname">Permanency</em> as part of the creation of a magic item is discussed under the ritual To Enchant A Wondrous Item. This casting does not age the wizard, but may instead reduce their Constitution.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>This powerful spell is a very specific kind of <em class="spell">Illusory Drama</em> which always depicts the same scenes, from the notional life and downfall of one <em>Hopnir</em>, an unfortunate necromancer. It is a cautionary tale, designed to enthrall and instruct the observer, replete with disturbing spectacle and booming soliloquies. Experienced casters of illusions will often recognise it as soon as it begins.</p>

					<p>All intelligent living creatures within the AOE of the spell, except the caster, must Save when the <em class="spellname">Tale</em> is cast, or else stand rapt, giving the show their full attention. They can attempt to Save again every 10 minutes thereafter; any successful Save allows a witness to break the spell and turn away. Any injury sustained also ends the <em class="spellname">Tale</em>.</p>

					<p>While enraptured, onlookers will take no other action, except to idly eat and drink. Their Perception is at -3 regarding all other happenings. The caster remains unaffected, and can take the opportunity to cast other spells, leave the area, or take other actions.</p>

					<p>When this spell is cast, the wizard creates the illusion of the most fearsome thing imaginable to the victim. It does not function on the undead, mindless or other-worldly creatures.</p>

					<p>Only the victim can truly see the <em class="spellname">Phantasmal Killer</em> (the caster witnesses only a shadowy shape). Once set, it seems to inexorably pursue the target, for it exists only in their mind. It will seem invulnerable to all attacks and appear to pass through any mundane barrier.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Killer</em> cannot reach a target under an <em class="spell">Aura Of Protection</em> or a <em class="spell">Puissant Domain Against Sorcery</em>, but will remain for the duration, seemingly intent on breaking through to its victim.</p>

					<p>The beast attacks once per round at a THACO of 18, with the following special modifiers:</p>

					<dl class="complex-terms">
						<dt>By surprise</dt><dd>+2</dd>
						<dt>Subject previously attacked by this spell</dt><dd>+1</dd>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Phantasmal Killer</em> can be ended by a single active attempt to <em>Disbelieve</em>, slaying the caster, or by rendering either the caster or the victim unconscious.</p>

					<p>Spells such as <em class="spell">Remove Fear</em> and <em class="spell">Cloak Of Bravery</em>, cast after the <em class="spellname">Killer</em> has attacked, grant another check to <em>Disbelieve</em> the effect.</p>

					<p>When this spell is cast, the wizard summons a sinister horselike creature to serve as a mount. The <em class="spellname">Steed</em> can be ridden only by the wizard who created it.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Phantom Steed</em> has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-coloured, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. Its eyes are milky-coloured. It bears no saddle or bridle.</p>

					<p>It will not fight, but all normal animals shun it and only monstrous ones will attack. The mount has an AC of 2 and 7 HP, + 1 / caster level.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Phantom Steed</em> moves at a movement rate of 100 ft. / round. It can bear its rider's weight, plus up to 10 lbs / caster level, but it will rear up to throw off any other creature.</p>

					<p>These mounts gain certain powers according to the caster's level:</p>

					<dl class="detailed">
						<dt>6th</dt><dd>The ability to pass over sandy, muddy, or swampy ground without difficulty, and leaving no tracks.</dd>
						<dt>7th</dt><dd>The ability to pass over water as if it were firm, dry ground.</dd>
						<dt>8th+</dt><dd>The ability to gallop across gaps of 30 ft. or less as if they were solid ground, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a bridge. The <em class="spellname">Steed</em> cannot casually take off and fly; the movement must be between points of similar altitude.</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>If the spell expires, or the mount or the caster is slain, the <em class="spellname">Steed</em> returns whence it came in a flaming burst of sulphurous smoke. A rider may suffer a painful fall if this occurs while at speed.</p>

					<p>This spell is said to have its origins in an ancient and decadent land, and to call upon Dark Powers that control such beasts.</p>

				<dd>
					<p><em class="spellname">Power Over The Elements</em> enables a wizard to change the weather over a wide area. It requires 10 minutes to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 x 10 minutes for the weather conditions to occur.</p>

					<p>The <em>current weather conditions</em> are determined by the DM, depending on the climate and season. The spell can change conditions according to the Weather chart, moving up or down both the weather type and the wind tables by up to three steps.</p>

					<p>It is possible to increase winds above gale force; the effects of high wind speed are as follows:</p>

					<dl class="detailed">
						<dt>Gale</dt>
						<dd>Small creatures cannot fly; missile attacks at -3; small objects will be blown about. Ground movement reduced by half. Causes 2d6 <em>Structural damage</em><sup>*</sup>.</dd>

						<dd>Medium creatures cannot fly; missile attacks at -4; trees stripped bare, minor damage to structures. Ground movement reduced to a quarter. Causes 3d6 <em>Structural damage</em><sup>*</sup>.</dd>
						<dt>Tumult</dt>
						<dd>Large creatures cannot fly; missile attacks are impossible; small trees are uprooted and structures damaged. Ground movement reduced to crawling. Causes 4d6 <em>Structural damage</em><sup>*</sup>.</dd>
						<dt>Hurricane</dt>
						<dd>Huge creatures cannot fly; missile attacks are impossible; large trees are uprooted and structures may be destroyed. Ground creatures may be blown away. Causes 5d6 <em>Structural damage</em><sup>*</sup>.</dd>
					</dl>

					<p class="note"><sup>*</sup> Structural Damage takes place over the course of the spell</p>

					<p>Normally weather patterns shift every 8 hours or so; the caster can allow this to happen naturally or fix the weather, forcing it to remain in his chosen conditions. A few hours in an area affected by <em class="spellname">Power Over The Elements</em> may allow creatures to realise that something unnatural is in effect; a successful <em class="stored nwp">Weather Sense</em> Non-Weapon Proficiency check is needed. </p>

					<p>By means of this spell, the wizard surrounds himself with an mobile barrier against sorcery. The space within is impervious to almost all arcane magic, and also prevents the functioning of magical items or spells within its confines. The <em class="spellname">Domain</em> is visible to others, often seeming to be a lucent bubble formed of dancing runes and distorted sigils.</p>

					<p>It is possible for three other M-sized creatures to huddle close within the <em class="spellname">Domain</em>, alongside the caster, but all four will have to remain still, or awkwardly shuffle along together if they want to move.</p>

					<p>Ongoing arcane effects will temporarily be nullified while inside the <em class="spellname">Domain</em>, leaping back to life once they move outside it.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Puissant Domain Against Sorcery</em> also hedges out <em>charmed</em>, summoned, or conjured creatures. However, it cannot be forced against such a creature; an attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the barrier, and continued pressure will break the spell. Normal creatures can enter the area, and enchanted objects are not barred, but have no magical power within it.</p>

					<p>This magic causes winds to gather around the caster, and his surroundings to darken. This effect builds up throughout the Casting Time, becoming a cloud of rumbling, buffeting winds and moist air lit by leaping sparks, which remains around the caster as he moves.</p>

					<p>All melee combat within the cloud suffers from -2 penalties To Hit, unless combatants are able to see in shadowy conditions. Missile fire into or out of the <em class="spellname">Thunderhead</em> is at a -3 penalty To Hit, due to the strong winds.</p>

					<p>All within the <em class="spellname">Thunderhead</em>, except the caster, must Save every round or suffer 1d4 damage from the sparks that shoot through it. Creatures bearing a great deal of metal Save with a -3 penalty.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>When <em class="spellname">Purulent Waft</em> is cast, the wizard summons a billowing mass of nauseous vapours, which seeps from the ground and will sicken breathing creatures caught within it. The mass remains static, roiling within the AOE.</p>

					<p>Any creature caught within the miasma must Save, or be left reeling for 1d4+1 rounds, even after leaving the <em class="spellname">Waft</em>. Failure applies a penalty of -2 to all rolls, a penalty of +2 AC, and forces them to make <em>Concentration</em> rolls in order to cast spells. Those who make successful Saves can leave the vapours without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining must continue to Save each round.</p>

					<p>These poisonous effects can be slowed or neutralised by appropriate magic. The <em class="spellname">Purulent Waft</em>'s duration is halved in a moderate breeze and is dispersed in one round by a stronger one, such as a <em class="spell">Gust Of Wind</em>.</p>

					<p>When <em class="spellname">Quivering Statue</em> is cast the wizard, or other willing creature, turns to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires one full round after the spell is cast.</p>

					<p>During the transformation, there is an <strong>20% -Con</strong> chance that the recipient dies from shock. If this occurs, the result is usually an ugly twisted amalgam of flesh and stone.</p>

					<p>If the spell is successful, the creature can withstand any mundane inspection and appear to be a stone statue. <em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magic</em> will discover a faint aura, however. Despite being in this condition, the petrified individual can see, hear, and smell normally. Their sense of feeling is mostly gone; only major impacts can be detected.</p>

					<p>The individual affected by <em class="spellname">Quivering Statue</em> can return to his normal state instantly, act, and then return to the <em class="spellname">Statue</em> state, all within the same Initiative Count. This shift usually applies a -3 to the <em>Surprise</em> rolls of enemies. If an attacker can act simultaneously, they can injure his fleshly form. These later changes of form do not require a system shock roll to survive.</p>

					<p>While a <em class="spellname">Statue</em>, the recipient is vulnerable only to harm that can damage solid stone. Heavy impacts from blunt objects or long falls onto a hard surface may injure them.</p>

					<p>If a <em class="spell">Transmute Rock To Mud</em>, <em class="spell">Sculptor's Hands</em>, or <em class="spell priest">Shape Stone</em> spell is successfully cast upon the recipient, they will usually perish.</p>

					<p>This spell requires the caster to hold a mundane staff as he casts it. Upon completion it begins to crawl with black light, and to give off an unsettling insectile buzz.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Radiant Stave Of Woe</em> is a +4 weapon that inflicts 2d6+1 HP damage on a strike, with several other effects. Only the caster can safely touch it; all others are affected as follows:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>One point of damage done is permanently lost, unless a Save is made. A <em class="spell priest">Heal</em> or similar magic will restore the injury.</li>
						<li>Its touch acts as a <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> of half the caster's level.</li>
						<li>Any caster hit loses 1 memorised spell at random; creatures with spell-like abilities lose the use of one for 5 rounds. In both cases a Save negates the effect.</li>
						<li>Finally, injury to the victim's mind may occur (roll d100):

					<p>This spell causes an unpleasant downpour of bloody drops within the AOE, along with a coppery, salty scent. The <em class="spellname">Rain</em> will drench all within the area, causing them to become susceptible to commands that involve violence and evil deeds. The downpour continues for the duration of the spell, and any creature that enters during that time will be saturated.</p>

					<p>Those affected are soaked and stained scarlet from head to foot, unless protected in some way from the <em class="spellname">Rain</em> - any kind of covering will suffice, such as a waterproof cloak held overhead.</p>

					<p>Otherwise, all the targets will feel a rising anger and urges towards violence. Until they are cleaned, they will have a -3 penalty to all mind-controlling effects that invoke anger, hate or battle.</p>

					<p>This includes <em class="spell">Blistering Taunts</em>, <em class="spell">Instil Emotion</em> (<em>hate</em>), specific <em class="spell priest">Commands</em> and <em class="spell">Suggestions</em>, but not <em>Charm</em> spells. The effects of <em class="spell">Sow Confusion</em> and <em class="spell">Sow Chaos</em> are biased by &plusmn;2 towards <em>Attack nearest creature</em>.</p>

					<p>The wizard employing the spell is able to probe the surface thoughts of one creature per round, getting simple instinctual thoughts from lower order creatures. <em class="spellname">Readings</em> can continue on the same creature from round to round, or can move on to other creatures.</p>

					<p>If used as part of a program of interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives an initial Save.

					<p>This spell requires the caster to inscribe a series of protective sigils upon their skin, using a mixture of inks made from powdered amethyst, toad blood and fennel leaves. These marks can be later covered by armour or clothing, if wanted. When complete, the magic surrounds the wizard with an aura that provides immunity to arcane curses of 4th level or below.</p>

					<p>The aura not only protects, it causes curses to rebound upon their casters. The caster can resist their own curses by making a Save, if the curse allows it. Otherwise they take full effect.</p>

					<p>If multiple creatures are targeted by a curse, <em class="spellname">Rebound Curses</em> protects only the caster.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Rebound Curses</em> is effective upon all of the following:</p>

					<p>This powerful spell implants a miniature watchful creature within the skull of the target; a <em class="spellname">Worm</em> able to hear and report on their thoughts.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Worm</em> relays the target's conscious thoughts to the caster, whenever the caster wishes to eavesdrop, even if they do not speak a language the caster understands. It cannot report on deeper, unarticulated thoughts, dreams or desires.</p>

					<p>This spell allows the caster and his associates to conceal themselves in a small other-worldly space, by climbing a magically-suspended cord.</p>

					<p>The caster and up to seven others can climb up the rope and disappear into this place of safety, where most creatures cannot find them. The rope can be pulled up into the hidden space to complete the concealment.</p>

					<p>It is possible for certain creatures to penetrate or see into the space from the Mundane Realm, and for Ethereal powers to affect those hidden.

					<p>With this spell, a wizard may empower a staff in order that it may memorise spells on his behalf. The staff is usually given to an apprentice or associate, so as to grant them extra magics in time of need. The staff in question must be of the finest workmanship, inlaid with <em>True Metals</em>, valuable gems and the like, to a value of at least 100gp. Such an object will usually require at least two weeks to carve and embellish.</p>

					<p>Once the spell is completed, the caster may choose which of his currently memorised spells he will place within it. A maximum of 1 spell level / caster level may be held in a <em class="spellname">Runestaff</em>, and no spell that requires any form of <em>Concentration</em> can be stored. The caster must also embed a secret command word within the staff. This stage of the spell requires 10 minutes Casting Time.</p>

					<p>Any wizard who holds the staff and who knows the secret command word may release its spells, even if usually unable to cast them for reasons of level or school. The spells take effect at the casting level of the original mage who placed them in the staff, with their usual Casting Times. Bards may not use a <em class="spellname">Runestaff</em>.</p>

					<p>These spells count against the original caster's memorisation slots until used, or until the original caster decides to end the <em class="spellname">Runestaff</em>, whereupon it becomes inert, and his slots return to him. A caster can do so from any distance and at any time; the <em class="spellname">Runestaff</em> will lose all its magical power instantly, although this may not be obvious to someone carrying it.</p>

					<p>If the caster should die, any leftover spell slots remain within the <em class="spellname">Runestaff</em>; ancient staves exist that still contain power.</p>

			<h3>Sanctuary Of The Grave</h3>
			<h4>4th lvl Necromancy</h4>
			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>One night; see below</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>0</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>10 ft. cube / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>Permanent</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p><em class="spellname">Sanctuary Of The Grave</em> allows a necromancer to make his home amongst the dead, within a coffin, grave, tomb, sepulchre, or similar resting place. The chosen location cannot already be Consecrated to a particular faith.</p>

					<p>The casting of this spell requires such a place, dedicated to burial or the inhumation of the dead. The caster must first break any seals about the area and remove any magical influences or wards via <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> or similar. He must then spend at least one night within, and ensure that it remains undisturbed by any other being, including undead not under his command. Before dawn, he must begin to cast this spell, which will require ten minutes for each 10 ft. cube of the tomb. A necromancer cannot partially dedicate an area; if it is larger than his possible AOE, he must choose another, smaller, locale as his <em class="spellname">Sanctuary</em>.</p>

					<p>If the <em class="spellname">Sanctuary</em> has gates, a lid or doors, a successful casting of this spell will secure them with a <em class="spell">Wizard Lock</em>. Past the entrances, the area will take on a chilly, unsettling air, obvious to any who trespass there. Lights will often gutter and seem unnaturally dim, and a faint stench will pervade the atmosphere. To detection spells, the entire area will radiate a low evil and show an aura of necromantic magic.</p>

					<p>Any attempt to Turn Undead within the <em class="spellname">Sanctuary</em> will be at a -3 penalty.</p>

					<p>While the original caster is within his <em class="spellname">Sanctuary</em>, he will automatically gain an ongoing <em class="spell">Essence Of Life</em> effect throughout the area. He can rest there in some safety; the <em>Essence</em> effect will wake him if he is asleep; and he requires only 75% of the normal rest to regain spells (so usually 6 hours). While interred within, the unpleasant energies sustain him, and he need not eat or drink. Furthermore, all his necromantic castings in the area have a additional Save penalty of -1, where a Save is allowed.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Sanctuary Of The Grave</em> is usually permanent. The effect can be suppressed for 2d10 minutes by a successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em>, or removed entirely by <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em>, <em class="spell priest">Dispel Powers</em> or the Ritual Of Consecration.</p>

					<p>This spell may be cast on the mage himself or on any other living, willing creature. The recipient must be cut so that their blood fills the caster's cupped hands (for a man-sized recipient this causes a loss of 2 Con). He then closes them and blows on them. Immediately his hands are forced open as a large hawk with blood-red plumage blossoms there.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Sanguine Hawk</em> is utterly loyal to the recipient of the spell. It understands Common but cannot speak itself.</p>

					<p>While the <em class="spellname">Hawk</em> is in existence, the blood loss of the recipient cannot be healed or restored by any means. They will often appear somewhat wan and unsteady.</p>

					<p>A recipient can have multiple <em class="spellname">Sanguine Hawks</em> in existence at a given time, as long as they can stand the blood loss. Each will remain until slain, dismissed or <em class="spell">Dispelled</em>. Only the recipient can choose to dismiss a <em class="spellname">Hawk</em>, and must do so by verbally commanding the thing to begone. Any of the methods of doing away with it will return the lost blood and Con to the recipient.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Eye</em> is AC 3 with 20 HP, and is damaged only by magical weapons and effects. Beginning on the second round of its existence, and again every second round after, it can send forth a narrow beam of clashing colours. This has the effect of a <em class="spell">Scintillant Spray</em> with a 50 ft. range, but can only affect one target at a time.</p>

					<p>This spell calls a vast throng of creeping insects, spiders and other arthropods, which will soon come upon the caster's location. There they will gather beneath him, raising him up on their chitinous backs and forming a great palanquin, eight feet wide or thereabouts. This can carry the caster and up to 150lbs of other non-living materials.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Steeds</em> will carry the caster wherever he wishes, keeping him held safely a few feet above the surface they travel over. They move at a steady rate of 30 ft. (or 3 miles per hour), and can travel over any kind of rough terrain, with their passenger always held in relative comfort. They can travel across streams without pausing, and even down or up near-vertical slopes.</p>

					<p>The vehicle they form is stable enough for their passenger to sleep upon, cast other spells or use missile weapons from while moving. If commanded to do so, the <em class="spellname">Steeds</em> will cling together to form an over-arching roof, which will suffice to keep rain or other inclement weather from their master.</p>

					<p>Most normal creatures will flee the approach of the <em class="spellname">Scuttling Steeds, Million-Strong</em> in horror.</p>

					<p>The swarm cannot attack, and has the equivalent of 30 HP, but can only be damaged by area-effect attacks and similar. Clouds of poisonous gas and the like may slay the entire horde.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Shandaril's Long Shadow</em> uses the caster's shadow as a scrying point</p>

					<p>This spell needs a nearby light source of at least candle-size, shining upon the caster. After completing the spell, the wizard's shadow stretches enormously, maintaining its normal tendency to run along the ground and up walls.</p>

					<p>Wherever the head of the <em class="spellname">Long Shadow</em> lies, the caster may hear, see and speak as if he stood at that spot. The caster can circle around the light source to aim the shadow in any direction he desires, so long as an opening exists through which it can extend.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Long Shadow</em> is invisible if it stretches off into darkness. If detected, it may be attacked via magical weapons and spells. If so, its AC is equal to the caster's, and damage done to it injures the caster.</p>

						<dt>Fear</dt><dd>This symbol creates an extra-strong <em class="spell">Know Fear</em> effect, causing victims to Save with -4 penalties to the die roll, or panic and flee for 1d4 rounds / caster level. Those affected are likely to drop whatever they are holding when struck by the spell; the base chance of dropping items is 60% at 1st level / HD, -5% per lvl / HD over.</dd>

						<dt>Hopelessness</dt><dd>Victims must Save or turn back in dejection. Affected creatures will submit to forceful demands from any opponent, including orders to surrender or leave. The hopelessness lasts for 3d4 x 10 minutes; during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures take no action during any round, and 25% likely that those taking action turn back or retire from battle, as applicable.</dd>

						<dt>Insanity</dt><dd>One or more creatures whose total HP do not exceed 120 become insane, acting as if a <em class="spell">Sow Confusion</em> spell had been placed upon them for 3d6 rounds. No Save is allowed.</dd>

						<dt>Pain</dt><dd>Victims must Save or be afflicted with wracking pains shooting through their bodies, causing a -2 penalty to Dexterity and a -3 penalty to attack rolls for 2d4 days.</dd>

						<dt>Sleep</dt><dd>Victims under 8+1 HD immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened without injury for 1d12+4 x 10 minutes. No Save is allowed, but only creatures that normally require sleep are affected.</dd>

					<p>This spell is cast on a leather or cloth garment that has been embroidered with the personal rune or sigil of the wizard.

					<p>Cast upon an existing fire or cloud of smoke, this spell will draw it into a wraith-like cowled form that can move to attempt to choke victims.</p>

					<p>The man-sized <em class="spellname">Smoke Ghost</em> cannot support solid objects, but it can envelop an opponent and attempt to suffocate them, filling their lungs with ash and smoke. The <em class="spellname">Smoke Ghost</em> can be made to swoop into the air after a target and flow through tiny gaps, making escape difficult. It moves at a maximum of 60 ft. / round.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Ghost</em> can only move when directed by the caster, who must maintain Minimal <em>Concentration</em> to do so. If he loses sight of it or his <em>Concentration</em> fails, it will hover in place.</p>

					<p>Once caught, a target can make a Save each round to escape. Being enveloped makes spellcasting and speech impossible, causes 1 HP of damage per round, and partially blinds the victim, so that they attack at -2 To Hit. After (Con/2) rounds of continuous choking, the victim will pass out for 1d4 minutes. Non-breathing targets suffer no damage from a <em class="spellname">Smoke Ghost</em>, although they may still be blinded.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Smoke Ghost</em> can be dissipated by a <em class="spell">Gust Of Wind</em> or strong natural breeze.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell, whose origins are obscure, is a specialised <em>Charm</em> effect that has power over animals, including those that are Giant-sized or Dire.</p>

					<p>To cast it, the wizard must begin a weird keening song in a lilting foreign tongue; his voice will carry eerily to the full range of the spell. Those animals (within the AOE) that can hear it must Save or fall under his command. Any damage inflicted by the caster or his allies in the round of casting grants the wounded creature another Save, at a bonus of +1 / HP of damage received.<p>

					<p>The caster must maintain Full <em>Concentration</em> on the strange melody, which will convey his wishes to the beasts. If for any reason the target creatures become unable to hear the caster, the effect ends until his voice is audible again, whereupon a new Save can be made to resist.</p>

					<p>Any affected creature regards the caster as a friend and an ally; it will follow reasonable requests, instructions, or orders faithfully. Any overtly hostile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at the very least allows a new Save against the <em class="spellname">Song</em>.</p>

					<p>If the <em class="spellname">Songs</em> are maintained for a long period, rolls against fatigue may be required, else the wizard's voice may give out and end the spell.</p>

					<p>This spell is used to create a warding token against a specific attack form. The <em class="spellname">Amulet</em> can protect only one creature, and only functions once.</p>

					<p>Each possible attack form has an object associated with it; once ensorcelled, this item must be displayed prominently for the protective power to work. Those in the know might recognise an <em class="spellname">Amulet</em> by type:</p>

					<dl class="detailed">
						<dt>vs. Blindness</dt><dd>A pouch of nutmeg, owl's feather and powdered eye agate, worn at the waist</dd>

						<dt>vs. Cold</dt><dd>A carnelian soaked in an infusion of peppermint, yarrow and elderflower and worn at the throat</dd>
						<dt>vs. Fire</dt><dd>A sunstone wrapped in basil leaves, tied into the hair or beard</dd>
						<dt>vs. Lightning</dt><dd>A <em>True Copper</em> badge marked with crushed holly berries, worn on the chest</dd>
						<dt>vs. Poison</dt><dd>A <em>bezoar</em> blackened with ash of vervain and worn on the wrist</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>Valuable materials for <em class="spellname">Amulets</em> vs. <em>Charms</em> and <em>Poison</em> cost 10gp; the others cost 20gp.</p>

					<p>Enchanting a <em class="spellname">Sovereign Amulet</em> requires that the caster prepare the item by hand and keep the object close by for the entire Casting Time, during which period he cannot cast any other spells.</p>

					<p>The protection it offers is total against any arcane or mundane effect of 3rd level or less, and against any similar power of a creature of 5 HD or less. It has no effect against divine magics.</p>

					<p>Once an <em class="spellname">Amulet</em> has functioned, it is destroyed. Some will melt, some crumble, some burn to ash or blacken and rot. <em class="spellname">Amulets</em> against <em>Fire</em> and <em>Cold</em> will function just once against magical or overpowering mundane effects, or else will sustain the wearer against weaker mundane injury for one hour.</p>

					<p>A creature can wear multiple <em class="spellname">Amulets</em> at a time, but they must be of different kinds.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Sovereign Amulet</em> loses its power within a month of being enchanted; the materials used to create it cannot be reused. This limit can be removed via <em class="spell">Permanency</em>, but the <em class="spellname">Amulet</em> will still only function once.</p>

					<p>To determine its chances of success and maximum weight allowance, the servant is considered to have Strength 18/00. The <em class="spellname">Porter</em> will not attack or touch other creatures, but might be able to act defensively otherwise - it can hold a door shut as a barricade, for example.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Porter</em> can only be injured by spells or weapons of +1 or better enchantment. It has AC 0 and 3d8 HP, +1 point / Caster level. If an enemy can see invisible things, it has AC 4, appearing as a smoky, indistinct being, about man-sized.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Porter</em>'s Saves are equal to those of the caster. It has a movement rate of 50 ft. / round, but cannot pass more than 150 ft. from its master, or else it winks out.</p>

					<p>If the caster should die, the <em class="spellname">Porter</em> immediately vanishes.</p>

					<p><em>Spendelarde</em>, the creator of this spell, is a wizard known mostly for his work towards minimising unnecessary effort.</p>

					<p>This spell confers the poisonous biting ability of a spider to the caster. Once in effect, this spell lasts until the user has made a number of bites equal to their level / 3 (round down). While it remains, the spell counts against memorisation slots, but the caster can always choose to end it at will.</p>

					<p>While under the spell, the caster is also protected by the equivalent of <em class="spell priest">Neutralise Poison</em>, and his skin takes on a faint greenish tinge. His canines also become a little longer and curved.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Spider's Bite</em> cannot penetrate armour or toughened skin; it is best used in a non-combat situation and against creatures without natural armour.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>When this spell is employed, the wizard can command any non-living rope-like object, including string, cord, or cable. The spell affects 50 ft. of normal rope (of about 1 inch diameter), plus 5 ft. / caster level. Thicker strands reduce the length proportionately.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Cord</em> cannot move more than about a foot by itself (usually it must be thrown towards a target), but within that area can be ordered to entangle, trip or bind any nearby creature or object. It will tie itself into stout knots as required, and can be told to hold itself taut or go slack.</p>

					<p>An active foe can avoid being caught or tripped each round by making a Save. A victim who trips will fall prone, whereas an entangled creature will lose the use of their arms until they can break free.</p>

					<p>Alternatively, the <em class="spellname">Cord</em> can be ordered to securely bind a creature who is already unmoving or restrained, or an inanimate object, in which case there is no Save.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Cord</em> cannot draw itself tight enough to inflict damage or throttle an enemy.</p>

					<p>A typical rope might be AC 6 and take 4 HP of slashing damage before breaking. It can be burst apart with a Save vs. Str at -3.</p>

					<p>This spell is believed to be the creation of <em>Jormunrek</em>, a magician of the barbarous Northlands.</p>

					<p>When this spell is cast upon willing creatures of man-size or smaller, up to 10 such creatures / caster level can be magically altered into trees, of any sort the caster desires. Thus, a company of creatures can be made to appear as a copse, grove, or an orchard.</p>

					<p>This spell replaces the target's shadow with that of the caster, who himself displays no shadow for the duration of the spell. By maintaining Full <em>Concentration</em>, the caster can dimly hear and see all that occurs within 20 ft of the recipient.</p>

					<p>This spell requires that the caster touch the shadow of the target. If attempted in combat this requires a roll To Hit.</p>

					<p>Within a single Realm it operates over any distance, but if the target moves into another Realm the <em class="spellname">Steal Shadow</em> spell is broken. The spell functions only while the target has a shadow - in an area of complete darkness no scrying may take place, until the target moves away again.</p>

					<p>While this magic is in effect, astute observers (Save vs. Perception at -3; one attempt only) may notice that the target's shadow neither resembles him nor apes his actions; it follows the shape and movements of its true owner.</p>

					<p><em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> can discover the effect. A successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em>, <em class="spell priest">Lift Curse</em> or <em class="spell">Remove Curse</em> will break the spell.</p>

					<p>A successful touch adds 2d4+2 years to the victim's age and subtracts 1d2 from the caster's. Creatures suffer or benefit from all the effects of aging, as appropriate.</p>

					<p> A victim slain by use of <em class="spellname">Steal Youth</em> will become a <em>Ghost</em>, rising 2d4 weeks after death. Such spirits will bear a consuming hatred for the wizard who slew them, and will seek them out.</p>

					<p>Otherwise the <em class="spellname">Meteors</em> leave a fiery trail of sparks, diverging slightly to end in four bursts of roiling flame around their destination. Each inflicts 5d8 HP damage. The set bursts in a diamond or box pattern 20 ft. across, and each blast covers a 25 ft. radius AOE, creating an overlapping centre exposed to all four detonations.</p>

					<p>Saves for each AOE apply, for half damage.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Meteors</em> can also ignite flammable materials, and melt soft metals such as gold, copper, and silver. Exposed items can Save to resist the heat. If carried by a creature that has itself Saved, items are not affected.</p>

				<p>This spell allows the caster to bring together the spirits of those buried nearby, forcing them to answer his questions. It must be cast on ground not Consecrated to any faith, and requires a lengthy period of preparation.</p>

				<p>To cast <em class="spellname">Summon The Spectral Throng</em>, a pit must be dug, six feet long by two feet wide and two feet deep. Into the pit the caster must scatter a handful of fragrant herbs, and pour a cup of good wine mixed with a pint of blood from another intelligent being.</p>

				<p>As the magic builds in power, ghostly figures will rise from the  graves within range and gather about the caster, pushing close into a dense crowd to await his questions. However, those who have undergone a ritual of Last Rites will remain quiescent in their resting places.</p>

					<p>This unpleasant necromancy allows the caster to steal the dying breath of a victim and use it to bolster themselves.</p>

					<p>It can only be used on a living, intelligent creature who is currently at less than 0 HP, and who has not stabilised. It requires that the caster clamp their mouth over that of the victim, to draw in their final breath.</p>

					<p>Dying but conscious creatures will usually attempt to resist the caster, and could bite, claw or otherwise throw off the wizard if not restrained. A victim trying to throw the caster off must make a Str vs. Str roll - the victim suffers a penalty equal to their current negative HP.</p>

					<p>If the spell is successful, the victim immediately loses all remaining HP and expires. These HP are transferred temporarily to the caster, who will retain them for the duration of the spell - the extra HP then vanish, possibly leaving the caster in an injured state. A caster can only benefit from one set of extra HP at a time.</p>

					<p>Those slain by this spell often return as vengeful <em>Ghosts</em>, especially if strong-willed in life, and may be driven to seek out their murderer.</p>

					<p>When this spell is used, the wizard instantly transports himself and what he can normally carry to a given destination. The effect usually manifests as a brief concealing cloud of smoke.</p>

					<p>A wizard cannot <em class="spellname">Teleport</em> to an area of empty space - a solid surface must be there to stand on. Areas of strong magical energies may make <em class="spellname">Teleportation</em> more hazardous or even impossible.</p>

					<p>Distance is not a factor, but inter-Realm travel is not possible. If the destination is very familiar to the wizard, it is unlikely that there is any error in arriving, although the caster has no control over his facing when he does. Lesser known areas increase the probability of error, with unfamiliar areas presenting considerable peril:</p>

					<p>This spell grants the caster a powerful premonitory sense in relation to himself or another.</p>

					<p>The wizard can specify that he or another is the beneficiary of the spell; if the recipient is another person, they must be within the initial casting range.</p>

					<p>Once the spell is complete, the wizard will receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger to the object of the spell. This includes obvious threats, such as a <em class="spell">Fireball</em> being aimed or an on-rushing gryphon, but also <em>Charms</em> and similar enchantments about to take place, traps about to be activated, and anything similar.</p>

					<p>When the warnings are about him personally, the caster cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from which an attack is coming, as well as some vague sense of the danger that threatens (perhaps a momentary glimpse of a burst of flames, or a great looming fanged shape).</p>

					<p>When another person is the object of the spell, the caster receives warnings about that person. This takes place no matter how far away the recipient is, even if in another Realm.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Presentiment</em> allows the caster to act 5 Initiative counts before the hostile action takes place. The wizard can shout a warning, cast a spell, or take another action if he does not hesitate.</p>

					<p>This spell continues to operate for the full duration. Each new source of danger will send another warning impulse; this will not usually happen on successive actions of the same combat, but can be triggered by a major change to the circumstances; for example, the arrival of a new and more dangerous combatant.</p>

					<p>When this spell is cast, it creates a cone-shaped area of extreme cold, originating at the wizard's hand. The air will usually become fogged with icy precipitation.</p>

					<p>The spell drains body heat from victims, causing 2d4 HP damage / caster level. Liquids touched by the <em class="spellname">Breath</em> must Save or be frozen solid, and non-magical non-<em>True Metals</em> must Save or be shattered.</p>

					<p>Additionally, all objects and creatures in the AOE will be covered with an icy rime, which makes them extremely slippery. Any creature in the area must make a Save vs. Dex each round they remain, or slip and fall. The rime remains for 1 round / caster level.</p>

					<p>This spell is also known as <em class="spellname">Winter's Fury</em> and its origins are believed to be ancient, predating the rise of Man's kingdoms.</p>

Neither the caster nor onlookers will necessarily know what the apparition is, although the victims' reaction will be obvious.</p>

					<p>In order for the spell to take effect, the caster must advance threateningly upon the target, who is allowed a Save to resist. If they fail, they will turn and flee in terror at maximum speed. They will continue to flee until they make a successful Save or the spell duration expires; they can try once each round.</p>

					<p>This spell must be targeted upon a melee combat that is already in progress. It is a subtle <em>Charm</em>, which instils a sense of combative honour in all within the AOE who fail a Save. It does not distinguish between friend and foe, but only affects intelligent living creatures.</p>

					<p>Those affected are unable to act dishonourably for the duration; this bars them from any use of poisoned attacks, striking from behind, outnumbering a foe of roughly equal power, attacking an unarmed target, and so on. The DM may need to adjudicate what constitutes dishonourable behaviour.</p>

					<p>By means of this spell, the wizard is able to move objects with a thought. The <em class="spellname">Gift</em> can provide either a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>A sustained force enables the wizard to cause a weight of up to 25 lbs to drift along at 20 ft. per round. This version has a range of 30 ft. / caster level. The spell lasts two rounds, plus one round / caster level.</p>
							<p>The object can be delicately manipulated, as if it were held with one hand. The weight can be moved in any direction; once it moves out of range it will drop to the ground or come to a halt.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Via a single thrust, the caster can hurl one or more objects or creatures (all within 20 ft.) directly away from himself, to a distance of up to 10 ft. / caster level.</p>
							<p>This is subject to a maximum weight of 50 lbs / caster level, and creatures affected are allowed a Save to avoid the thrust. Damage caused by thrown objects is decided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 HP / caster level.</p>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>Negates</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell causes the immediate growth of a creature or object. Unwilling victims are entitled to a Save. It can be cast only upon a single creature, or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cu. ft. in volume / caster level.</p>

					<p>The target grows by up to 25% / caster level, increasing in height and width, and proportionally by weight. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the target attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials - the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.</p>

					<p>A creature's HP, AC, and To Hit rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.</p>

					<p>The reverse, <em class="spellname">Curse Of Dwindling</em>, negates <em class="spellname">Thrilling Stature</em> or makes creatures or objects smaller. The target loses 25% of its original size / caster level, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch - the target will not dwindle away to nothingness.</p>

					<p>A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell is an improved version of <em class="spell">Ruinous Touch</em>, in that it allows the caster to destroy inanimate non-enchanted objects of leather, wood or rope. <em class="spellname">Touch Of The Workman's Wrath</em>, however, can affect substances in a more subtle way.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Touch</em> can rot and crumble up to one coil of rope, half a suit of leather armour or half a cubic foot of wood each minute, if both the caster's hands are free. However, the harm done is not immediately apparent, as it takes place beneath the surfaces touched. A detailed and purposeful examination is required to detect that an item has been ruined. Any attempt to use the item (e.g. putting substantial weight on a rope) will cause it to break, crumble and fall to pieces.</p>

					<p>Complex mechanisms, such as a catapult, can easily be rendered useless with this spell by damaging the vital parts of the device, even if the object as a whole is too large to be affected.</p>

					<p>Any material affected by this spell can avoid its effects by Saving at a -2 penalty; this Save must be repeated each minute if the caster continues his attempts.</p>

					<p>Against wooden structures, <em class="spellname">Touch Of The Workman's Wrath</em> causes 3 <em>Structural damage</em> / minute.</p>

Non-magical weapons have no Save against the effect; enchanted weapons can Save as their wielder, with a +1 bonus for each 'To Hit' bonus they have.</p>

					<p>The spell takes effect the round after it is cast, with its own Initiative roll. If it occurs before their wielder's turn, they lose any remaining chances to attack that round while they wrestle with the weapon. In any case, on its own Initiative Count, the weapon will twist and attack its wielder.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Traitorous</em> weapon attacks as if wielded by the victim, and if successful its strike causes damage likewise, with all appropriate effects.</p>

				<dd>
					<p>This spell turns natural, non-magical rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud, which (if free-standing) will usually then slump under its own weight.</p>

					<p>Creatures heavier than a cat and unable to <em>levitate</em>, <em>fly</em>, or otherwise free themselves from the mud sink at the rate of 1/3 of their height / round, and may eventually suffocate. Trying to escape by swimming forcefully through it is at a rate of 3 ft. / round.</p>

					<p>Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it, with the amount required decided by the DM. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom and still breathe can move through the area at a rate of 10 ft. / round.</p>

					<p>The mud remains until a successful <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> or the reverse of this spell restores its substance - but not necessarily its original form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt at a rate of 1d6 days per 10 cu. ft. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.</p>

					<p>The reverse, <em class="spellname">Transmute Mud To Rock</em>, permanently hardens non-enchanted mud or quicksand into a soft stone. Creatures in the mud are allowed a Save to escape before the area hardens; otherwise they are trapped. Dry sand is unaffected.</p>

			<dl class="spellinfo">
				<dt>Casting Time:</dt><dd>4</dd>
				<dt>Range:</dt><dd>30 ft. / 2 caster levels</dd>
				<dt>AOE:</dt><dd>10 ft. cube</dd>
				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>1 hour + 10 minutes / caster level</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None; see below</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This powerful spell enables the caster to bring into being a mystic prison to entrap enemies. It traditionally appears as a cube of black iron bars, carved and ornate, but other variants are possible; the gaps between the bars are never narrower than two inches, however. The <em class="spellname">Cage</em> also extends across the top and floor of the AOE, forming a complete trap.</p>

					<p>Creatures within the AOE of the spell are caught unless they are able to pass through the openings.</p>

					<p>A creature with <em>Magic Resistance</em> has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the <em class="spellname">Cage</em>. If the Save is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is trapped. A successful Save does not destroy the <em class="spellname">Cage</em>, nor does it enable other creatures (except familiars) to flee with the escaping creature.</p>

					<p>The bars of the <em class="spellname">Cage</em> are impervious to all harm, and cannot be broken by force or magical energies. They can be <em class="spellname">Dispelled</em>, <em class="spell">Wished</em> away, or the occupants can free themselves by magical means such as <em class="spell">Teleport</em>, <em class="spell">Dimension Door</em>, or by escaping to the Realm Ethereal.</p>

					<p>If the caster should die, the <em class="spellname">Cage</em> will melt away to nothingness within moments.</p>

					<p>The origins of this spell are said to predate the rise of Man's kingdoms.</p>

					<p>This spell imbues the caster with an unpleasant and hungry energy which he can release upon a victim, to take their vitality for his own.</p>

					<p>When the caster touches an opponent in melee with a successful attack roll, the opponent loses 1d6 HP for every two caster levels, to a maximum drain of 5d6 points. The HP are added to the caster's total - it is possible to go beyond the caster's normal total. Any damage to the caster is subtracted from the temporary HP first.</p>

					<p>After ten minutes, any extra HP above the caster's normal total are lost.</p>

					<p>Undead creatures are unaffected by this spell.</p>

			<h4>7th lvl Alteration, Conjuration <span class="spelltype" data-filttype="Ethereal">Ethereal</span></h4>

				<dt>Duration:</dt><dd>See below</dd>
				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell causes an inanimate object to be <em class="spell">Teleported</em> away to a place of the caster's choosing, either in the Mortal Realm or the Ethereal.</p>

					<p>The object cannot weigh more than 50 lbs / caster level, and cannot be larger than 3 cu. ft. / caster level. <em class="spellname">Vanishment</em> does not affect animate creatures or magical forces.</p>

					<p>If the <em class="spellname">Vanished</em> object shifts within the Mortal Realm, the caster will need to roll on the <em class="spell">Teleport</em> table to discover whether the object arrives safely:</p>

					<table>
						<caption>Teleportation by Familiarity</caption>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Knowledge of destination</th>
								<th>Arrive too high</th>
								<th>Arrive on target</th>
								<th>Arrive too low</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr><th>Very familiar</th><td>01-02</td><td>03-99</td><td>00</td></tr>
							<tr><th>Studied carefully</th><td>01-04</td><td>05-98</td><td>99-00</td></tr>
							<tr><th>Seen casually</th><td>01-08</td><td>09-96</td><td>97-00</td></tr>
							<tr><th>Viewed once</th><td>01-16</td><td>17-92</td><td>93-00</td></tr>
							<tr><th>Never seen</th><td>01-32</td><td>33-84</td><td>85-00</td></tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p>Arriving high means the object will appear 10 ft. above the ground for every 1% rolled below the lowest on target chance. Any low result will necessitate a Save for the object, or it will be buried, usually leaving some part protruding above the surface.</p>

					<p>However, if desired, a <em class="spellname">Vanished</em> object can be placed deep within the Ethereal Realm. It will always arrive safely, and while he cannot specify the exact destination, the caster will have a vague understanding of how to reach it there. He will be able to find the object in 2d6 hours of searching, once in the Realm. However, as time passes, it is possible for the item to be removed or destroyed by passing Ethereal denizens; powerfully magical objects are quite likely to draw their attentions.</p>

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly and toxic vapours, usually a vile greenish-yellow in colour.</p>

					<p>The cloud is highly poisonous, with effects as follows:</p>

					<h5>Miasma effects by HD / Level:</h5>
					<dl class="simple">
						<dt>Less than 4+1</dt><dd>Slain, no Save</dd>
						<dt>4+1 to 5+1</dt><dd>Save at -3 or die</dd>
						<dt>5+1 to 6</dt><dd>Save or die</dd>
						<dt>More than 6</dt><dd>Take 2d6 damage each round</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>The venom enters through the skin as well as the breath, so many mundane defenses will not prevent poisoning.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Virulent Miasma</em> moves away from the caster at 10 ft. / round, rolling along the surface of the ground. As the vapours are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level, pouring down into openings. They cannot penetrate liquids, nor can the spell be cast under water.</p>

					<p>A moderate breeze causes it to alter course, but it will not move back toward its caster. A strong wind (e.g. <em class="spell">Gust Of Wind</em>) breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force disperses it immediately. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Admonishing Fist</em> never misses, but it can only strike as directed by the caster, who must maintain Minimal <em>Concentration</em> in any round where he uses it. The effectiveness of its blows varies from round to round - roll 2d10:</p>

					<p class="note"><sup>*</sup> Against a <em>stunned</em> target, further <em class="spellname">Fist</em> rolls are at +3.</p>

				<dd>
					<p><em class="spellname">Visaque's Castigating Hand</em> creates a huge, disembodied hand, usually of somewhat bloated, fleshy appearance. The <em class="spellname">Crushing Hand</em> is under the unspoken control of the caster, and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze an opponent or other objects.</p>

					<p>No attack roll is necessary; the <em class="spellname">Hand</em> automatically grasps and inflicts constriction damage in any round in which the wizard maintains Minimal <em>Concentration</em>. It is even effective against Ethereal or incorporeal targets, of any size, great or small.</p>

					<p>A victim held by the <em class="spellname">Hand</em> cannot move, and can only cast spells that have no somatic components.</p>

					<p>The damage inflicted depends on the number of rounds it acts upon the victim:</p>

					<p>If the original opponent is slain or escapes out of range, the caster can designate a new target for the <em class="spellname">Hand</em>.</p>

					<p>If the <em class="spellname">Hand</em> grasps an item, a Save for the material must be made at an Effect Power of 12. Small constructions, no bigger than a hut, can also be crushed, sustaining 15 points of <em>Structural Damage</em> each round.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Castigating Hand</em> has AC 0, has as many HP as its caster at full strength, and vanishes when destroyed. It is susceptible to normal combat attacks and damaging spells, but if it is struck by an area-effect spell, the person held suffers the same fate as the <em class="spellname">Hand</em>.</p>

					<p>This spell enables the caster to create a disembodied <em class="spellname">Fist</em>. Forming at the end of the round in which the spell is cast, the hand is normally unseen to all but the caster.</p>

					<p>It can move 50 ft. / round, but cannot pass beyond spell range from the caster. The <em class="spellname">Fist</em> can hover in mid-air, swoop, swerve, and dart through openings as the caster directs, but it will disappear if the caster cannot maintain Minimal <em>Concentration</em>.</p>

					<p>The  <em class="spellname">Fist</em> can perform one action per round. It is as dextrous as the caster's own hand, and can turn keys, pick pockets and perform any similar action as he desires.</p>

					<p>It can grasp objects of hand-size or less, and up to 1 lb weight, and carry them for the duration. Such objects may be in the possession of another creature, but if they are being held the <em class="spellname">Fist</em> does not have the strength to tear them free.</p>

					<p>Alternatively, it can push or slap a single creature, striking at the caster's THACO +2, inflicting 1d4 HP <em>Subdual Damage</em>. A successful attack by the <em class="spellname">Fist</em> ruins spellcasting during the round it strikes. A <em class="spell">Shield</em>, <em class="spell">Aura Of Protection</em> or <em class="spell">Aegis Against Missiles</em> spell will block the attacks of <em class="spellname">Visaque's Flying Fist</em>.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Flying Fist</em> can be damaged by mundane or magical attacks - it is AC 3 (AC 7 to opponents who can see invisible), and has 5 HP.</p>

					<p>When this spell is cast, the wizard <em class="spell">Teleports</em> some desired item from virtually any location directly to his hand. The single object can be no longer than about 4 ft. in any dimension, must not weigh more than 10 lbs, and must be inanimate.</p>

					<p>To prepare this spell, the wizard must utter all but the final word of the conjuration, while holding a carnelian of not less than 500 gp value in one hand and the item to be summoned in the other. The gem becomes magically inscribed with a description of the item; the words are invisible and unreadable to all but the caster, unless <em class="spell">Second Sight</em> or similar is used. It is usual for the item to also bear the caster's <em class="spell">Wizard's Sigil</em>, prominently marked.</p>

					<p>At some point in the future, he must utter the final word while holding the gem, which instantly becomes a puff of worthless smoke and dust. This part of the casting requires just 1 Initiative Count. If the item bears the caster's <em>Sigil</em>, or in any case is not on the person of another creature, the desired item is then transported instantly into the caster's other hand, wherever it may have come from.</p>

					<p>If the item is unmarked, and is on the person of another creature, that creature will feel an odd tugging, which they can resist with a Save. If they fail the Save, the item will vanish and re-appear in the caster's grasp. In either case, the companion gem in the hands of the caster is destroyed, and the <em class="spellname">Prompt Summons</em> effect ends.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Prompt Summons</em> can fetch an object from another Realm, no matter how distant.</p>

					<p>This magic allows the caster to prepare an area to allow him a means of escape via a targeted <em class="spell">Teleport</em>.</p>

					<p>Preparing the spell requires the wizard to enscribe his <em class="spell">Wizard's Sigil</em> upon a visible surface at his desired sanctum. It must not be concealed or hidden, or the spell will not work, and the <em class="spellname">Rune</em> will be recognisable as his by those in the know. The caster must be very familiar with the chosen spot and its surroundings, having spent several days there at a minimum.</p>

					<p>The resulting symbol has a magical aura, and can be permanently removed via <em class="spell">Erase</em>, or by being physically destroyed.</p>

					<p>Once the <em class="spellname">Rune</em> is placed, the caster can step back to it from anywhere within the same Realm by speaking a single word (requiring 1 Initiative Count). There is no chance of this <em>Teleport</em> failing, although various wards can block its functioning. After he arrives, the wizard needs 1 round to organise his thoughts before he can take any other action.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Rune</em> operates only once for each casting; it must be re-drawn once used. A given caster can have only one <em class="spellname">Rune Of Beloved Harbour</em> in existence at a time, and while it remains, it occupies one 6th-level spell slot.</p>

Any finger-sized or smaller object that touches the caster also becomes invisible, preventing them from being discovered by <em class="spell">Glittering Dust</em>, <em>dust of appearance</em> or similar methods, such as a bag of flour or thrown paint. The caster remains invisible in the area of any spell that would cancel or reveal it, and is immune to <em class="spell priest">Faith's Corona</em>. Discovering the caster's location is more difficult as a result of these subtle improvements; a Perception roll to even gain a general idea of the caster's whereabouts is at -8.</p>

					<p>The spell masks all sounds from leaving the space the wizard occupies, but does not prevent sounds from entering. This makes the caster effectively silent to others, but allows them to hear their surroundings. It also does not prevent the caster from speaking, so they can cast spells with a verbal component, though their voice cannot be heard. This prevents spells such as <em class="spell">Shout Of The Titan</em> from functioning.</p>

					<p>Also, the caster's odour is neutralised, and cannot be discovered or tracked by a creature using their sense of smell.</p>

					<p>The caster leaves no marks, footprints or tracks at all, as if under the effect of <em class="spell">Pass Without Trace</em>.</p>

					<p>If the caster remains undetected, they can automatically achieve <em>Total Surprise</em> on a foe.</p>

					<p>The wizard's <em class="spellname">Imperceptible</em> nature causes them to be ignored by all forms of divination spells and effects that would detect their presence or any information about them. This includes all <em>Detect</em> spells, scrying devices and spells, and methods of reading and detecting thoughts. It includes both Arcane and priestly magics.</p>

					<p>They also do not trigger any magical effect that would normally react to their presence, such as <em class="spell">Alarum</em>, <em class="spell priest">Glyph Of Warding</em> and similar, though they can still activate spells that trigger when read (such as <em class="spell">Phandaal's Vitriolic Critique</em> or <em class="spell priest">Symbol</em>).</p>

					<p>At any time, the caster may temporarily suppress the effects of this spell with a mere thought. As long as the spell continues, the caster may later become <em class="spellname">Imperceptible</em> again, at a cost of 3 Initiative counts.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Walk In Dreams</em> enables the caster to send messages to others when they sleep.</p>

					<p>At the beginning of the spell, the caster must name the recipient. For <em class="spellname">Walk In Dreams</em> to function, the recipient must be within the same Realm, currently asleep, and not magically protected.</p>

					<p>As the caster completes the spell, he too falls into a deep sleep, and projects his mind into the recipient's dreams. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance.</p>

					<p>Once a dream has been entered, the caster can deliver a complex and detailed message, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the sender gain useful information by observing their dreams.</p>

					<p>Once the message is delivered, the sender's mind returns instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the sender to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.</p>

					<p>The reverse of this spell, <em class="spellname">Call Up Nightmare</em>, enables the caster to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the recipient, who is allowed a Save to avoid the effect. If the Save is failed, the <em class="spellname">Nightmare</em> prevents restful sleep and leaves the recipient fatigued and unable to regain spells for the next day.</p>

					<p>However, <em class="spell priest">Dispel Powers</em> cast upon a victim of a <em class="spellname">Nightmare</em> stuns (-3 To Hit and -2 AC) the caster of <em class="spellname">Call Up Nightmare</em> for 10 minutes / caster level of the <em class="spellname">Dispel</em>.</p>

					<p>The origins of this spell are said to predate the rise of Man's kingdoms.</p>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This rare and powerful magic does not come into operation until another spell is cast within its AOE. When that occurs, a huge, shining ornate wheel instantly appears where the caster originally stood (even if that spellcasting occurred centuries before). It will begin to turn, with a gentle rushing noise, and will absorb the energy of all arcane spells cast within its AOE, so that they fail to function, but serve instead to power <em class="spellname">The Wheel</em>.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">The Wheel</em> does nothing except turn, faster if powerful magics are absorbed, more slowly for weaker effects. Once activated, it will not disappear until dispelled; if starved for magical energy, it will merely turn more and more slowly, and gradually grow dim, until it hangs motionless, translucent and ghostly.</p>

					<p>This spell has no power over divine magics or items. Living creatures can pass through the AOE of an active <em class="spellname">Wheel</em> without harm; it does not drain spells from minds.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Wheel</em> cannot be dispelled by <em class="spell">Dispel Arcane Magic</em> (which it will absorb), nor affected by physical attacks (which pass through it as though it does not exist). A <em class="spell">Wish</em>, <em class="spell">Petty Wish</em>, or successful <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em> will destroy it.</p>

					<p>This spell's AOE extends through rock and void alike in a perfect sphere; it cannot be easily avoided by use of <em class="spell">Open The Way</em> or <em class="spell">Wittlehatch's Marvellous Excavation</em>.</p>

					<p>This spell is thought to have been created by the vampire necromancer <em>Vivamort</em> of Tol-In-Gaurhoth.</p>

				<p>This fearsome magic imbues the caster's whispered words with a hideous and mind-destroying power.</p>

				<p>It can affect any living creature with a sense of hearing and Int greater than 1, except those of other-worldly origin. Beasts and dumb animals will be driven to excesses of terror by the <em class="spellname">Whispers</em>, while those more intelligent will have their sanity clawed away in moments as understanding dawns.</p>

				<p><em class="spellname">Whispers Through The Black Gate</em> must be heard to take effect; very loud surroundings and various sound-blocking magics can prevent it from functioning.</p>

				<p>The rolled effect of the spell is permanent, and will reoccur whenever the caster comes closer than 30 ft. to the victim. If the victim is separated from the caster, they will become cognisant again after 1d4 rounds.</p>

				<p>Ending this curse can be accomplished via a <em class="spell">Remove Curse</em> from a caster of equal level, a priestly <em class="spell priest">Lift Curse</em>, or a more powerful magic such as <em class="spell">Petty Wish</em>.</p>

					<p>This spell is a boon to the traveller; it summons up a powerful mistral, carefully directed to sweep along those it affects and speed their journey.</p>

					<p>The caster can choose to affect additional creatures; four Small creatures are equivalent to two Medium- or one Large-sized being.</p>

					<p>All those affected must be moving in the same direction as the caster; while they do so they can travel at double their usual long distance rate. If any of the participants chooses to stop, they can move aside from the <em class="spellname">Wind</em> and no longer be affected; they may be left behind by their companions. The caster can choose to end the spell at any time.</p>

					<p>If the caster is at least 7th level, they can choose instead to target the <em class="spellname">Wind</em> upon the sails of a boat or ship, increasing the <em>movement rate</em> by 5 mph. The maximum size of vessel affected depends on caster level:</p>

					<h5>Vessel size by level:</h5>

					<p>A caster can choose to affect a smaller boat or ship; each size lower than their base gives another +5 mph to the vessel's speed.</p>

					<p>The effects of <em class="spellname">Wind At Your Back</em> upon a boat or ship do not necessitate a check against <em class="stored nwp">Boating</em> or <em class="stored nwp">Seamanship</em> NWPs.</p>

					<p>This spell does not predispose the subject towards the caster in any way.</p>

						<li>...and many other effects</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The use of a <em class="spellname">Petty Wish</em> will not substantially change reality, nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking.</p>

					<p>The Casting Time of 10 Counts assumes that the wizard has already prepared the wording of the spell; this may require a lengthy period, as determined by the DM. In dire need, a <em class="spellname">Petty Wish</em> can be cast without preparation, requiring only 5 Counts, but there is a chance of the caster stumbling over their words, perhaps with dangerous consequences.</p>

					<p>Many wizards believe that the Powers which grant <em class="spellname">Petty Wishes</em> are in fact Demon Lords, bound to do so by ancient pacts, and that they greatly resent the obligation.

				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This great illusion allows the caster to create a new, almost-real, being of whatever kind and appearance he desires.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Wistful Shade</em> must be of the same race as the caster, but can have any seeming the wizard requires. It cannot duplicate a real person, however, and will always have an odd and other-worldly mien.</p>

					<p>It will have average attributes, excepting only Int, which can be of any value less than the caster's, and Cha, which can be of any value less than 20. It will have Saves and other rolls equivalent to a 0 lvl character, and no useful skills or training. The <em class="spellname">Shade</em> can converse in one language that the caster knows, although it will be innocent and without knowledge of the world.</p>

					<p>Its weird and unearthly demeanour gives it unconscious powers to <em class="spell">Charm Person</em>, which can affect any person (except the <em class="spellname">Shade's</em> creator) who spends more than an hour in its company. A Save allows the influence to be avoided; once a Save has been made, the <em class="spellname">Shade</em> cannot <em>Charm</em> that creature again.</p>

					<p>The being will not grow older, forever remaining at the age its master chose for it, and it cannot learn new skills or materially progress. It has an independent existence from its caster, but is always compelled to follow the wizard's orders when given. <em class="spellname">Shades</em> must eat and drink, albeit sparingly, or else wither and fade away. They seem to sleep, but lightly and fitfully.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Shade</em> is immune to all <em>Charms</em> and <em>Suggestions</em>, necromantic effects that age, and to attempts to possess it (e.g. <em class="spell">Magic Jar</em>).</p>

					<p>The nature of a <em class="spellname">Wistful Shade</em> can be seen via <em class="spell">Second Sight</em> or <em class="spell priest">Reveal</em>, or in the fifth and later rounds of <em class="spell">Azaelin's Plundering Of The Mind</em> cast upon it.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Shade</em> can be slain by inflicting more than 6 HP of damage, or by a successful use of <em class="spell">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em> or <em class="spell">Wish</em>. Whenever a <em class="spellname">Shade</em> perishes, its body dissolves into no more than a light dew.</p>

					<p>In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one; if the wizard continues downward past 20 ft. in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 ft. dug beyond 20. Sand tends to collapse after 10 ft., mud fills in and collapses after 5 ft., and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.</p>

					<p>Any creature at the edge of a pit, or rushing towards one that appears, must roll a successful Save on 2d10 vs. Dex, or fall into the hole. A creature in a pit being excavated can clamber out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a Save to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful.</p>

					<p>It is possible to tunnel sideways with this spell, as long as there is space available for the removed material. Chances for collapse are doubled, and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless the construction is carefully braced and supported.</p>

					<p><em class="spellname">Wittlehatch's Marvellous Excavation</em> is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, such as Clay Golems and beings from the Elemental Court of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 HP damage. A successful Save (including <em>Magic Resistance</em>) reduces this damage to half.</p>

					<p><em>Wittlehatch</em>, the creator of this spell, is a mysterious figure rumoured to be stranger than most.</p>

				<dt>Save:</dt><dd>None</dd>
				<dt class="desc">Description:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible and disembodied eye that shows him what it sees.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Wizard Eye</em> travels at 50 ft. / round if viewing an area ahead as a human would, or 30 ft. / round if closely examining its surroundings. The <em class="spellname">Wizard Eye</em> can see in the dark up to 20 ft., and with normal vision up to 60 ft. in brightly lit areas. The <em class="spellname">Eye</em>'s powers of vision cannot be enhanced by other spells or items.</p>

					<p>Using the <em class="spellname">Eye</em> requires the wizard to maintain Full <em>Concentration</em>. If his concentration is broken, the spell does not end - the <em class="spellname">Eye</em> merely becomes inert until the wizard again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell.</p>

					<p>The <em class="spellname">Eye</em> has substance, and can pass through a space as small as a mousehole. Solid barriers prevent its passage, however.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Wizard Eye</em> may cause observed creatures to feel a nagging sense of being spied upon. The base chance of this happening is equal to the subject's Int as a percentage, modified as follows:</p>

					<dl class="complex-terms">
						<dt>Each Level / HD</dt><dd>+10%</dd>
						<dt>Subject makes <em class="stored nwp">Animal Lore</em> roll</dt><dd>+20%</dd>
						<dt>Subject originates from another Realm</dt><dd>+25%</dd>
					</dl>

					<p><em class="spell">Detect Arcane Magic</em> or <em class="spell">Detect Scrying</em> may also reveal the <em class="spellname">Eye</em>.</p>

					<p>A <em class="spellname">Wizard's Eye</em> can be swatted from the air and destroyed; it has AC -2, owing to its small size and invisibility. If it can be seen, it has AC 2. It is also subject to being destroyed by any number of spell effects in its area. It has 5 HP.</p>

					<p>The caster suffers the effects of any gaze attack, glaring lights or blindness met by the <em class="spellname">Eye</em>.</p>
