How to use:

- unzip into a folder
- drag or otherwise open one of the two HTML files in a browser
- NB: functionality in Internet Explorer is very wonky; use Firefox, Chrome or Safari

- an open spell overlay can be dragged (via the spell's name)
- double-click on the spell name to roll the overlay up
- in Firefox there are also some new context menu items; right-click on an overlay

Printing should be fine; it will look best if you turn 'Print background images and colours' on.

Credit for spells I have used from other sources will appear here; I'll happily remove anything people have a problem with.
