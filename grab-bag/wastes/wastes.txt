## 0720

Al'az Zulg, God of Misogyny and Shame, grows in power with each self-destructive sacrifice its followers proffer. Its material form is that of a gigantic, nude, bloated, floating, hermaphroditic human.

## 0808

A group of Ram-Horned spies are making their way North to get information on Sir Gregor La Scala's forces in Hex 0805.

Shadowed by mountains part of the day and receiving rain from a weather fluke (see conditions in Hex 1601), these few miles of scrubland are tended as the holy site of ~6ft intelligent mantises.

Half buried in the sands here is the Pyramid of The Serpent Headed Prophet. Though looted of its original treasures millennium ago, the pyramid, when it hasn't been forgotten under sands, has periodically served as base of operations for one group of undesirables or another, most recently, to a particularly bloodthirsty and brutally effective gang of bandits led by the nomad turned assassin, Kamal the Killer, who wields the deadly blade "Spiller of the Silver Blood."

## 1609

The Great Wyrm of Gloom, Techatnazl, burrows endlessly here, causing shifting sands, uncertain footing, and no end of sadness in the slave quarters of the far reaches of the Northern Outpost of the Great Empire of KARAKT-ZUL directly to the East.

The Imperial Seat of The Great Empire of KARAKT-ZUL floats high above the waters here on waves of magical energy being subtly sapped from the Sandstone Elementals of Hexes 1815 and 1916, though none now living know this or much else of the ancient magics of this tremendous and beautiful &quot;City Above the Sea.&quot; Transport to and from the city is accomplished in giant scarab styled gondolas lifted by Rocs charmed and thus controlled by the Illustrious Vizier of the Aires. The beautiful Seranda el Teran, cousin to the Emperor, is the current holder of the powerful Amulet of Aire which confers this title and such control over Rocs, she will thus pay handsomely for the hatchlings of the Rocs in Hex 0508 or simply information about such.

The water here is extremely deep almost impossibly deep. At the bottom lurks some beast only knows as &quot;the deep one&quot;

## 2016

Several nuns from the DAUGHTER OF THE MOUNTAIN MONASTERY (Hex 1917) frolic in the shallows here. A reef of iridescent coral can be seen beneath the water. The coral is harvested by the nuns and made into enchanted jewelry. If anyone attempts to vex the nuns, a giant golem made of Coral will rise from the water and attack.

## 2017

For the Giant Dragonflies and Wasps that breed in the fungus of Hex 2018 the water here is a portal to Hex 0819 of Hexenbracken, and they fly back and forth often; this will work for any that ride them, although they are not easily tamed. For any not riding a Giant Dragonfly from this area it is a normal sea inlet.

## 2018

An old building made of decaying books is overtaken by the fungal forest; a few spellbooks can still be harvested. Eating the fungus here causes nausea and hallucinations, but at the end of a month one will grow small dragonfly wings and be able to use the waters of Hex 2017 as a portal once per day. The Giant Dragonflies and Wasps of Hex 2017 breed and feed here, but mainly live in the neighboring hexes.

## 2019
