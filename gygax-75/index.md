## Introduction

In 1975 Gary Gygax wrote an article describing a simple approach to creating a campaign world over 5 weeks, which you could then expand upon through play: like God intended. Ray Otus took this article and expanded on its ideas to create [a structured work book][gygax75] with concrete steps for each week and his own example of creating a small campaign setting. [Recently Dungeon Possum posted about his plans to go through this process.][dp75] This got me interested in doing the same. I am keen to create a basic-ass fantasy setting. I normally gravitate towards Gonzo He-Man nonsense. Playing Dark Souls and Demon Souls over the last year has me interested in Arthurian fantasy—by way of a confused Japanese man. And so that's what I will go with. We'll call it **Misericorde** for now, until I figure out the names for things in this setting. — Ramanan, Feb 2022

## Week 1!

### The Pitch

- A land of grey skies and perpetual rain. Farmland, fields, and forests. Stone walls guard wooden homes with thatch roofs. Standing Stones. Barrows. Villages built inside hills and caves. Witches hiding in forests. Wizards in towers. Knights, of course.
- Far from your home is the Castle by the Water. The former seat of power is now home to the Dragon, who defeated the Good King and levelled that great city ten years past. Your countryside is now ruled by petty warlords, bandits, and far darker beings none dare speak of.
- The names of the Good King’s knights fade from people’s memories, but all twenty survived that day. From Agralan the Gloom Knight to Sina the Star Knight, they all quest about. Some with bloodlust in their eyes terrorize all they encounter. Others protect whomever they meet in the hopes of atoning for their past failure.
- Magic is a rare art, usually practiced by the wicked, a source of calamity. Most people will tell you the last good wizard was Ellenel, who perished by his lord's side when the Dragon took the Castle by the Water.
- Players are aspiring adventures, all human. There are no demi-humans. Players can learn magic as per the rules of *Wonder and Wickedness*. Advancement is diegetic—you gain power by gaining power.

### Inspiration

- *The Buried Giant* by Kazuo Ishiguro: a dreamy and fantastic sort of England, with knights, dragons, magic, and all the good stuff.
- *King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table* by Roger Lancelyn Green. A children’s retelling of the Arthurian stories, and beside's Patrick Stuart's adaptation of The Green Knight, my only real source of knowledge about these stories.
- *The Green Knight* by David Lowery: A beautiful film, and Gawain our protagonist is a brown dude to boot.
- *Ninja Scroll*: Peak 90s anime, the films presents a fantastic feudal Japan. There are lots of ideas you can transplant into a world of knights, wizards, farmers, bandits, etc.
- *Sui generia* by Brendan S: I love Brendan’s idea for creating a setting by making the generic unique. There is one dragon. There is one troll. They have names and histories and a solid place in the world.
- *Dark Souls*: I love this view of Western fantasy, mysterious and confusing.
- The minis I painted for my Zornheim war band. They look like people I might imagine in this setting. Sort of, anyway: we don't have guns in long ago fantasy England.

### The Wilderness

Play begins in the town of Llangolen. The Hidden Crypt is known to the players' characters and the townspeople. It is a burial site from ages past, accidentally unearthed, no doubt full of treasure, mystery, and danger. Some other points of interest are noted below, and labeled on the map above. (The map was created using [Hex Kit][hexkit], with [tiles by Thomas Novosel][tn].)
