## Session 1

Players:

- +Gus L 
- +Eric Boyd 

Recap:

The Rainbow Connection, a travelling acting troupe, were attacked and captured by a strange spherical robot while travelling through the wastes of Carcosa. They awake outside an alien outpost surrounded by bodies in various states of decay and mutation. Behind them lays a mysterious alien outpost, in front of them more nondescript wastes.

- They feel woozy and lethargic.  Searching the area they find random knickknacks, but also quickly realize everyone now dead is horribly mutated in some way. 
- Lacking proper supplies for an aimless overland trip they venture into the outpost.
- Opening some large garage doors the party comes face to face with their captor. The robot rests in what looks like a bay of some sort, ignoring them. They back away and leave the robot alone. The second door into the base takes them into a small room.
- The base is quiet, and seemingly empty.
- There is still something powering it: the hallways are lit, and random computer screens flash strange inscrutable messages.
- Venturing further into the base the party finds a large open work area that looks to be unused.
- The party quietly explore. A room that looks to be another entry way to the complex contains nice warm furs for everyone to wear, but is otherwise bare.
- The next door the group opens reveals a room full of rock specimens: some look to be quiet valuable. They are all stored behind glass, that feels a bit warm to the touch. The greedy Mr. Smith opens up the glass to get a closer look, and suffers a terrible mutation for his trouble: he now stinks thanks to some newly grown boils on his body. 
- The next room the party discovers is filled with crates, but also a strange Spawn—a blue hexapod with a gaping circular maw. They make quick work of it, and end up with a Bazooka of some sorts for their efforts.
- The party avoided one Jale Slime and killed another with fire.
- The party released a seemingly mad Bone Man into the wild. He was apparently imprisoned by the other Bone Men, though the party does not know why. He looked to have been left to die: he smelled terrible and was starving when discovered.
- The Green Man Greenox was killed trying to grab a weapon from the weapons cache. The room filled with poison gas. Mr. Smith quick closed the door to the room, so the rest of the party was safe.
- The alarm that was triggered startled the Bone Men that lived in the basement of this outpost.
- the Illustrious Prince of the Bone is the leader of the Bone Men, who decided to spare the party if they put on a show.
- The party promised to never reveal the location of the outpost, or ever return.
- the Queen of Autumn leads the party from the outpost towards Invak.
- a merchant caravan takes party the rest of the way, grudgingly. The party gives them a wide berth, and follows at a distance.
- They arrive in the town on Invak late at night.

Treasure:

- 6 large furs: they are very warm (you can sell each for 15 GP to the traders currently in town).
- Bazooka: you don’t know how many charges it has, or what it does, but its clear it still works. 

Monsters Killed:

- Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (300 XP)
- Jale Slime (100 XP)

People Entertained:

- 25 Bone Men and their children﻿

The Rainbow Connection, now joined by some new friends from the town on Invak, decide to make some cash exploring the region for Desert Lotuses, which the apothecary The Falling Flower will happily buy. 

- 2 hours out of town, to the North East, the party encounters a band of 5 over-confidant Jale Slavers while looking for Desert Lotus filled caverns.
- They initially parlay, but then realizing that slavers without slaves are probably carry currency decide to attack.
- They make reasonably quick work of the slavers, with minimal injuries. They find manifest for 14 sold slaves and 700 GP in the Citadel of ???? to the North.
- For their efforts they are rewarded by The Swift and Silent Beginning, the leader of Invak, with an additional 500 GP for each dead slaver and 100 GP for recovering this manifest.
- The rest for the day—for no mechanical benefit, harsh Ram—and head out again in search of caverns.
- Heading South West they come across a small opening that leads into a bigger cavern. It's damp and dewy, and seems like a prime candidate for being filled with weird flowers that don't need light to grow because they are so magical of course.
- Venturing South they find an empty camp site, that seems to have been recently used. 
- To the West they stumble upon an obvious pit trap. Exploring the cavern below they find what they thought were flowers, but turned out to be some strange plant that would knock out those who lingered too long.
- Resting in the room with the pit trap after all this exertion, some strange insectoid beasts ambled down off the ceiling.
- The party retreated to the North, the creatures uninterested in pursuit.
- Heading west the party finds their first Lotus, a blue flower.
- Further West still they stumble upon Purple Men cultists, dragging an Orange couple.
- There is some arguing, cut short by a blast from a Bazooka.
- A purple man sorcerer enters the fray from a room to the West. He shoots Evan's character with a ray, and he is teleported to the surface.
- As the tide turns the sorcerer retreats into back into his room. He frees a giant plant Spawn and then shoots himself with his ray.
- The purple men turn to flee. Two manage to escape.
- On the surface, Evan's character and the sorcerer grapple, but Evan's character is victorious. He feasts on the brain of his foe.
- The battle is long and hard, Horace is cut down by a Purple Man, Gux is killed by a strange plant Spawn.
- The party explore the sorcerers abode, and find strange alchemical supplies and a ladder and hatch that lead to the surface.
- They return back to town!

+Beloch Shrike - Orange Man Fighter
+Bryan Mullins - Gloss-o-lalia (Lalia),  Dolm Woman Sorcerer

Recap:

- The party ventures south west in search of healers for Mr. Smyth
- Just before dusk they encounter some escaped slaves, orange men who have fled the slaver city.
- They reveal the slaves that aren't taken to be sold are poorly chained up outside the citadel, beaten amd kept in a weakened state, and guarded by men and women who ride dinosaurs.
- No one else in town is escaped from the Jale Men's citadel, so this is a pretty remarkable situation
- The party sends them on their way with food and continues south west. They see a tall pillar reaching out toward the sky. As they get closer they can see a smaller 40' pillar of smooth poured stone next to the matching larger one. On top of this pillar is a Jale man. The party speaks with him briefly, and he sends them East where a White Man is supposed to be.
- Continuing they encounter a Black Man who they speak to briefly. They learn a little bit about his life via Brendan’s character’s ESP. 
- They ignore all other pillars till the teach the White man. The party pretends Mr. Smyth is a mute, for the fear his mind will be controlled by the mystic.
- The mystic can’t cure Mr Smyth’s mutation, but can offer up prophetic visions via dreams.
- The party sleeps for the night, and Mr Smyth learns of a dungeon to the North where his cure might be found. He sees the entrance to a dungeon, choked with dead bodies, beyond which lies a Serpent Man.
- Fuck travelling to the North for a character Gus doesn’t even like. The party heads back to Invak, and plans to head North to the Putrescent Pits of the Amoeboid Gods.
- Along the way they avoid a group of White Men marching away to the East, along a river to the North.
- The party heads West and finds a strange citadel full of Bone Men.
- The Bone Men seem to be having a shitty time: some of them have recently died due to some issue with their water supply, others from a strange cyborg to the West, and some from capture by the slavers.
- The party heads to the Putrescent Pits of the Amoeboid Gods, but only explores it briefly.
- They fight a Spawn of Shub-Niggurath  and call it a day.

+Beloch Shrike  -  ???, Orange Man Fighter
+Evan Webber  -  The Spangled Inquiry, Bone Man Sorcerer

Recap: 

The rainbow connection were resting in the cavernous castle, home to the Ideal of Decline and his sad group of Bone Men. They debate heading North back to the Putrescent Pits, or South in Invak to help start some sort of alliance between the two towns.

- The party suggest to the Ideal of Decline that they abandoned their crazy castle and come live in Invak.
- He is wary of the idea, but sends 6 of his Bone men with the party to investigate the town and report back.
- In Invak the party meet with the Speaker of All Graces, and decide that it’s the red moon and they should save those slaves.
- The Speaker of All Graces is always down for fucking with slavers, and provides one of his best lieutenants and 40 men to help the party.

- The citadel seems strangely abandoned.
- The party does some scouting, and then attempts to scale the walls.
- The grappling hooks alert two Orange Men inside.
- A crazy fight breaks out—I bet Zak S has some rules for mass combat in Vornheim I could have used here.
- The Orange Men have laser guns, but are about as good a shot as Cobra.
- Things are overwhelmingly going the parties way until the interior doors to the citadel are opened, and the giant spawn god, a huge feathered frog with a beak, lets out a croak that scares most everyone in the battle.
- A small number of reinforcements join the fight, but in the end they are also put down quite quickly.
- Nick’s character is eaten by the terrible toad.
- The Spangled Inquiry had been shooting at the frog with his teleportation ray for several rounds, finally hitting the beast when it was perhaps almost dead. The beast disappeared into the wilderness, and presumably ran off.
- Searching the citadel reveals a stash of valuable gems.
- The Speaker's lieutenant gives the party the first 3 gems (100 GP, 5000 GP, 5000 GP). "The Speaker of all Graces would thank you for pushing us to finally finish these slavers off. I will do so in his stead: 100 GP a slaver to your strange troupe. The remaining treasure we split evenly. The money due to the dead will be given to our home Invak. I will keep 35 men here with me to secure the fort these slavers wasted with their idiocy. My remaining men will head south with you and he freed slaves to report to the Speaker of all Graces. Tell him to send word of what he wishes to do here."
- 35 Bone Men and the lieutenant stay behind in the citadel, the party returns to Invak the next day.
- There was much rejoicing.

## Session 6

Players:
+Hyades Shall Sing Dion - Usha Rey, Ulfire Women Fighter
+Willie Burke - Grenn, White Man Sorcerer
+Eric Boyd - Orange Julia, Orange Women Fighter
+Beloch Shrike - Red Man

The party begins the session in Invak.

The party travels south from Invak to Jahar.
The trip is uneventful. They travel through the night to make it to the town in one day. They camp outside of town, but encounter nothing.
Unlike Invak, Jahar is particularly xenophobic.
One of the guards is aware of the Rainbow Connection, and lets the players into the town.
Most of the people manufacturing goods in the town, along with the guards, have a fairly negative reaction to the party.
The merchants in town have a more positive disposition.
The party meets the person who runs the “resale items” shop, along with his children. They pick up some random knick knacks.
They meet the sage that lives in town.
For 10 GP he tells them two locations that he thinks feeds the water in the Castle of Decline, which could be the source of the human waste and guts that are poisoning the water
For free he lets the party know their map of the Putrescent Pits of the Ameboid God is probably junk. The story goes that a cult worshiped the god, that lived in an impossibly deep pit to the North. They would feed the beast all the gold and jewels they could find. Another cult came and fought the god and its cultists, culminating in sealing the god underground by building the mountain range on top of it. He lets the party know that mountain ranges form over millions of years, and this story is probably nonsense.
The party learn about a citadel to the North East, hidden out of sight. Some merchants saw it a few days back, but avoided the site. The sage will pay 10GP for information confirming its existence.
The party ventures off in search of the site, which they find without any complications.
It appears to be sealed from the inside. The party doesn’t want to make a noise by breaking down the front door, or a trapdoor in the roof.
A cavern near the Castle is also found, and explored.
The party encounters a group of 6 Mi-Go’s. They kill one and then flee. The Mi-Go’s make a half-hearted pursuit.
The party returns to Jahar, where they let the sage know of their findings.

Treasure: 10 GP paid by the Sage.

- Provide clue about next complication.﻿

Players:

+Dion Williams  - Osha Rey
+Willie Burke - Grenn, White Man Sorcerer

The party begins the session in Jahar, where they returned with the body of a dead amoured space alien and a Bone Man cultist who attacked them on the road. They learned of the base the cultists presumably operate out of.

 - Since there were only two players today the group decided to avoid the cultists enclave and head South with the traders.
 - The party ended up in the city of Glom, the trip South was uneventful.

## Session 11

+Chris P.
+Eric Boyd
+Beloch Shrike
+Dion Williams
+Willie Burke

- The party decides to remain in and around Glom for the time being.

- Rumours of emerald wearing deep ones send the party south to the lake.
- There they see a group of cultists camped near the statue and pillars visible last session.
- They approach closer, and start examining the pillars: rituals!
- Then they get shot at.
- A fight!
- The obvious cultists put up a mediocre fight, missing like the cast of G.I.Joe.
- The party are victorious after a protracted fight. Captives are freed. New rituals learned. Success!

Treasure:

- 500 GP
- 5 Gems:
  1: 1000 GP
  2: 1000 GP
  3: 100 GP
  4: 500 GP
  5: 100 GP
  - 2700 GP
- 6 wax figurines of deep ones
- 4 Naginatas (6 grabbed by captives)

Rituals:

Summon Amphibious Ones - This eleven-hour ritual can be completed only on a fog-shrouded night. The Sorcerer must obtain the root of potency found only in ruined apothecaries of the Snake-Men. The sacrifice is a virgin White girl. As her life leaves her body, 10–100 of the Amphibious Ones will coalesce out of the mists.

The Blasphemous Sacrifice (to Bind Amphibious Ones) - This ritual cannot be performed on its own, but only as an adjunct to the SUMMON THE AMPHIBIOUS ONES ritual. It adds an hour to the time required to complete the ritual (thus twelve hours total). The sacrifice is further subjected to an hour of unspeakable tortures before being slain. At the end of the rituals, the Sorcerer will have complete control over the horde of Amphibious Ones for 24 hours.

The Call of Cthulhu (to Summon Cthulhu) - This 24 ritual must be cast while waist deep in the polluted waters of Carcosa. Once the ritual chanting and genuflection begins, the sorcerer must drown a Purple Men at the end of each hour of the ritual. All the victims must be a willing sacrifices to the Great Old One Cthulhu. When the life leaves the last of the Purple Men, Cthulhu will rise up from the waters.


##  Session 12

Players:
+Dion Williams 
+Brendan S 
+Gus L 
+Chris P. 
+Eric Boyd 

- The party travels from Jahar North towards the “abandoned” space alien outpost.
- They see that it is guarded by two Bone Men, so they venture in via the radioactive wastes.
- The large centre room is filled with 9 bone men, reviewing maps and papers on large tables. The characters surprise the group, and kill a few before they can even retaliate. A few manage to flee to the basement.
- A long drawn out fight takes place on the main floor. Bone Men from various rooms join in. The party also encounter Bone Men from the original tribe that were living here, who join them in trying to shake off these cultists.
- The characters make their way to the basement, making quick work of two guards below.
- Moving forward they make their way to where they believe they will find the leader of the cult.
- More cultists are killed, and tribesman recruited, as the party marches forward.
- In the middle of the battle, the The Dominant Reflection looks to have made a break for it, his “throne room” sits empty.
- The party continue to travel around the basement in search of the sorcerer, but only encounter other former members of the Bone Men tribe, whom they free.
- By the time the party makes it back up to the top floor, and out the front door, the sorcerer looks to have fled.
- The party rest in the Space Alien Outpost, where they are heralded as heroes.

Notes:

- The Queen of Autumn was not amongst any of the people killed or freed. The leader of the Bone Men believes she escaped when the Sorcerer originally returned with his band of cultists to take over the ‘town’.
- The leader of the town, the Prince of Bone, gives your characters a 500 GP blood red ruby from the vault you passed when you first entered the basement.
- The Prince of Bone reveals that while they have no power over the Spherical Hunter Killer robot, they quickly learned that it can not “see” Bone Men. It completely ignores them. They also confirm your suspicion that it only hunts at night. They leave it alone.
- The Prince of Bone reveals that the sorcerer was previously imprisoned by the Bone Men here, because he was crazy-ass-crazy. They don't know how he escaped, though they think it probably happened around the time Gus and Eric were previously here. He doesn't put two and two together, because he's so happy to be free. (You will recall you freed a naked Bone Man from a cell and fed him, before letting him run off into the wastes.)
- As before, the Prince of Bone asks that you not reveal to anyone the location of the town.

Treasure:

- The heads of 23 bone men cultists, whose bounty will be collected in Invak. (100GP per cultist killed or 2300 GP once you return to Invak)
- 500 GP gem
- 173 GP in random coinage from the 23 dead cultists.
- One laser gun (Brendan’s character has it)﻿

—

The party begins in the newly liberated space alien outpost. Before it becomes truly abandoned, they decide to investigate the remainder of the complex.

- Renoir attempts to shatter the glass door on top of a pod. His sledgehammer bounces right off.
- The party leaves the room, heading to the West most room. Inside they find a room full of strange plant life.
- The floors are littered with some dead plants and fruit, but not enough considering no one has been in here for years.
- While picking fruit the party sees that various autonomous robotic arms, etc, look to be taking care of the plants.
- The party moves to the centre room, the last remaining unexplored room.
- There is a large cylinder in the centre of the room that extends down into the ground. It pulses with red light. It’s cordoned off by a circular railing. The room is full of computers, and everything looks to be in working order.
- Orange Julia pushes a big red button!
- Slowly the pulsing of the cylinder comes to a halt. The lights in the complex turn off, and the sound of doors opening can be heard throughout the complex.
- In the dark, the PCs here another sound, the sound of the pods full of aliens opening.
- The party waits a beat to see what happens. They hear the sound of an alien retching. 
- Realizing the aliens might be disoriented from being in stasis for so long, Renoir decides to cold-cock one and kidnap him.
- Alien on his shoulder, the party book it out of the complex. Everyone else is milling around outside, confused by the loss of power.
- Seeing the party running away, they join in.
- Once a reasonable distance away, the two groups of captives head off: the Orange Men to their town to the East, Joi; the Brown Men to the merchant town Jahar.
- About half way to Invak the party spot what looks to be a giant frog off in the distance. That’s strange. Could it be the Frog-God Llothali, worshipped by those crazy Orange Men to the North. Yes, it probably is. How many giant-ass toads could there be?
- The party decide to take a longer detour to reach Invak.
- On the way they startle a group of 4 slavers.
- Bargo charges in and completely brains one.
- The rest flee post-haste.
- The party gives chase, but without more range weapons pursuit seems fruitless. (I should look up the LotFP chase rules, they might have been a better option for that part of the game.)
- The party regroup and head to Invak, where they are greeted as heroes.
- The Swift and Silent Beginning thanks the players for ridding the world of more cultists, and for helping fight the slavers. (You have more renown in the town.)
- Upon learning there is a space alien that was “rescued” from the complex, he asks that the creature be brought to him to be freed.
- The party wake up the alien, who has a surprisingly positive disposition.
- He is confused about where he is, what the date is, and what has transpired since his last week long shift at the space alien outpost.
- The party informs him that they saved him, that the rest of his comrades presumably died years ago.
- He decides to stay in Invak for now.
- The new bone men also start to settle in to their new home.
- The party travels South to Jahar.
- Orange Julia’s pack lizard is worn down from all the travel and dies in Jahar. (The merchants will buy his body to be turned into rations for 50GP—I forgot to mention in the session!)
- The party sell their weird alien fruit and call it a day.

Treasure:

- 100 GP for killing a slaver
- 550 GP for weird fruit
- 50 GP for pack lizard body.

233 GP/XP each﻿

- It turns out they had been exploring to the East, in the towns the party rarely frequents.
- Many towns to the East are friendly with the slavers—someone has to be buying the slaves, after all
- They think the party are foolish to be heading towards the Snake Men ruins—they seem to be superstitious when it comes to the Snake Men
- The party continues on, coming upon a solitary bone man standing alone.
- As they try and move past him they see that there are other such bone men in the distance.
- Chongo decides to investigate what’s up with these Bone Men by cutting the first one they saw down.
- As he charges the man spins his head around and starts screaming—perhaps they have some sort of supernatural alertness
- Chongo kills the bone man, no problem, though even in death the creature seems ‘off’

- The party heads west towards Torok, to investigate it’s relationship with the Slavers.
- The trip West is uneventful.
- They arrive in the evening, and decide The Bone Crone will play Queen Zelda, the Bone Men henchmen her guards, the rest of the party her slaves. 
- The towns people are willing to buy her story, and put up their illustrious host in what amounts to a fancy hovel.
- The party visits a nearby bar and proceeds to buy boozes for the towns people. 
- They learn about the strange creature Yog that lives in the centre of town, that it is placated by a steady diet of slaves and the sweet singing of maidens of the village, and that the town buys slaves from the Jale Slavers.
- That’s enough for the party to decide it’s time to burn this mother down!
- They pay some patrons to get the word out to the militia there are free booze going around at the bar.
- They investigate Yog and come up with a plan: they will torch the bar and hopefully a good chunk of the towns militia, kidnap the singing maiden, and book it.
- This more or less works out: they are stopped by 6 towns people, but 2 of that group are convinced this whole Yog thing is really dumb, the remainder are vaporized, with one survivor running off into the night.
- The party hops the wall and watches Yog destroy the town in the moonlight. 
- They head back to Invak with two wandering monster encounters worth of complications!﻿
