  1011:
    - "In the basement of a long abandoned Space Alien outpost lay row upon row of Space Aliens in cryogenic sleep pods. They have been waiting hundreds of years for their shift to start."
    - "Spawn of Shub-Niggurath (AC 14, MV 160, HD 10, Chaotic): a Black batrachian with a feathered hide, two eyes, and beaked mouth. Known as the Frog-God Llothali, it strikes fear into all who hear its thunderous croaking (Save vs. Magic or flee in fear, can be used once every 5 rounds)."
    - 4 Jale Men (AC 14, MV 120', 1+1 HD, Neutral), members of the notorious group of slavers that terrorize the region.
restock:
  - "The Dominant Reflection (AC 16, MV 90', HD 4, Chaotic) and his small band of surviving cultists have captured the Carcosans that removed them from their former home. They now travel West towards the Snake-Men ruins."
  - "The sole survivor of a group of Jale Men slavers disfigures the bodies of his compatriots killers: a warning to those who would stand against the slavers."
  - "The Frog-God Llothali rests after satiating itself on the bodies of a group of Carcosans. It will happily ignore creatures that happen upon it. A cache of laser guns and coinage can be found within its belly."
  - "Waking from their cryogenically induced long slumber, a large group of Space Aliens begin cleaning up and repairing their long abandoned outpost."
