Is [Luke Gearing][luke] too powerful? Certainly. Luke's latest work for [Tuesday Knight Games][tnk] is [Gradient Descent][gd], a megadungeon written for [Mothership][]. The braintrust at Mothership HQ asks the question, "can you fit a megadungeon in a small zine?" Yes, apparently you can. How does it play? Let's find out.

## House Rules and Procedures for Play

**Combat:** Instead of making opposed rolls during combat, players simply make a normal combat check. If they succeed they roll damage. An enemy can make an armour save to reduce the damage rolled by half. This is inline with what the online Mothership community is doing, and what [Sean][] himself suggested.
