I have made several little web apps that will hopefully be of some use to you. 

 * The [Random D&D Character Generator][1] is probably the most popular thing I have hosted here. It will generate a random 1st level D&D character. It's handy if you play in a game that's a bit of a meat grinder. You can generate characters for the following rule sets or settings: [1974 OD&D][2], [Holmes D&D][3], [Basic D&D][4], [Pahvelorn (OD&D)][5], [Carcosa (OD&D)][6], [Delving Deeper][7], and [LotFP (Beta!)][8].
 * [Random Carcosa][carcosa] is my attempt to reverse engineer Carcosaâ€”to some extent.
 * [A Random Dungeon with X rooms][dungeon] will generate the craziest dungeons in the world.
 * [The LotFP Summon Spell][lotfp] will help you cast the summon spell from LotFP. I have no idea how people used that spell before. I suspect there was probably a bit more suspense and you rolled a lot of dice and flipped through a rule book. This was the first of these web apps that I wrote.
